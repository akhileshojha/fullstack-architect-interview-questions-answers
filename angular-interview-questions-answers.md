Here are Angular interview questions and answers starting from number 1:

### 1. **What is Angular?**
   **Answer:** Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is developed and maintained by Google and is a complete rewrite of AngularJS. Angular applications are structured into modules, components, services, and other entities that work together to create a web application.

### 2. **What are Angular modules?**
   **Answer:** Angular modules are containers for different parts of your application. They help organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Every Angular application has at least one module, the root module, which is typically named `AppModule`. Modules can contain components, services, directives, pipes, and other Angular features.

### 3. **What is a component in Angular?**
   **Answer:** A component is a fundamental building block of an Angular application. It consists of three key elements:
   - **A TypeScript class** that contains data and logic.
   - **An HTML template** that defines the view.
   - **A CSS selector** that specifies how the component is used in HTML.

### 4. **What is data binding in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Data binding is the synchronization of data between the model (business logic) and the view (UI). Angular supports several types of data binding:
   - **Interpolation:** `{{ expression }}` - One-way data binding from the component to the view.
   - **Property Binding:** `[property]="expression"` - One-way data binding from the component to an element's property.
   - **Event Binding:** `(event)="handler"` - One-way data binding from the view to the component.
   - **Two-way Binding:** `[(ngModel)]="property"` - Two-way data binding where changes in the view are reflected in the component and vice versa.

### 5. **What are directives in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Directives are classes that add behavior to elements in your Angular applications. Angular has three types of directives:
   - **Components:** Directives with a template.
   - **Structural directives:** Change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).
   - **Attribute directives:** Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive (e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`).

### 6. **Explain Angular services and dependency injection.**
   **Answer:** Services in Angular are used to encapsulate and share logic across multiple components. They are typically used for data retrieval, business logic, and other utilities. Angular's dependency injection (DI) system allows you to inject services into components and other services, promoting modularity and testability.

### 7. **What is Angular CLI and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps to automate the development workflow of Angular applications. It provides commands to create, build, serve, and test Angular projects. The CLI also simplifies the setup and configuration of new Angular projects.

### 8. **What are Angular pipes?**
   **Answer:** Pipes in Angular are used to transform data before displaying it in the view. They can be used for formatting dates, numbers, and other data types. Angular provides several built-in pipes, such as `DatePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, and `UpperCasePipe`, and you can also create custom pipes.

### 9. **What is routing in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Angular's routing system enables navigation between different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA). The `RouterModule` is used to define routes and associate them with components. When a user navigates to a specific URL, the router renders the corresponding component.

### 10. **What is the difference between `ngIf` and `*ngIf`?**
   **Answer:** `ngIf` is a directive used to conditionally include or exclude elements from the DOM. When using `*ngIf`, the asterisk (`*`) is a shorthand that tells Angular to treat the directive as a structural directive. This means Angular will add or remove elements based on the condition.

Certainly! Here are more Angular interview questions and answers starting from number 11:

### 11. **What is the purpose of `ngFor` directive?**
   **Answer:** The `ngFor` directive in Angular is used to iterate over a collection (such as an array) and render a template for each item in the collection. It is a structural directive, which means it can add or remove elements from the DOM based on the iteration. The syntax is: `*ngFor="let item of items"`.

### 12. **What is the difference between `@Component` and `@Directive` in Angular?**
   **Answer:** 
   - `@Component` is a decorator that marks a class as an Angular component and provides configuration metadata, such as the selector, template, and style properties. Components have a view (HTML template) associated with them.
   - `@Directive` is a decorator that marks a class as a directive. Directives are used to add behavior to existing elements. Unlike components, directives do not have their own view.

### 13. **Explain Angular lifecycle hooks.**
   **Answer:** Angular provides lifecycle hooks that give you the opportunity to tap into key moments of a component's life:
   - **`ngOnChanges`:** Called before `ngOnInit` and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.
   - **`ngOnInit`:** Called once, after the first `ngOnChanges`.
   - **`ngDoCheck`:** Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.
   - **`ngAfterContentInit`:** Called after Angular has fully initialized all content of the directive/component.
   - **`ngAfterContentChecked`:** Called after every check of the content.
   - **`ngAfterViewInit`:** Called after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
   - **`ngAfterViewChecked`:** Called after every check of the component's views and child views.
   - **`ngOnDestroy`:** Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive/component.

### 14. **What are Angular forms and how do they differ?**
   **Answer:** Angular provides two approaches to handling user input through forms:
   - **Template-driven forms:** Simple forms using Angular directives and attributes in the template. They are easier to use but less flexible.
   - **Reactive forms:** More powerful and scalable, allowing for more complex validation and dynamic forms. They are defined using the `FormGroup` and `FormControl` classes in the component's TypeScript file.

### 15. **What is `ViewChild` and `ContentChild` in Angular?**
   **Answer:** 
   - **`@ViewChild`:** Used to access a child component, directive, or DOM element from within the parent component's class. It is typically used for direct DOM manipulation or interacting with child components.
   - **`@ContentChild`:** Used to access content projected into a component (using `<ng-content>`). It allows you to query content that has been passed from a parent component.

### 16. **What is Angular's change detection mechanism?**
   **Answer:** Angular's change detection mechanism is responsible for updating the view whenever the data in the model changes. Angular uses a `zone.js` library to track asynchronous operations and then trigger change detection automatically. This ensures that the view stays in sync with the model. The change detection can be optimized using `OnPush` strategy, which limits the checks to specific scenarios, like changes to input properties or events.

### 17. **What is lazy loading in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Lazy loading in Angular is a technique to load modules on demand instead of loading all modules at once when the application starts. It improves the application's load time and performance. Lazy loading is usually configured in the `AppRoutingModule` using the `loadChildren` property.

### 18. **What is Angular Universal?**
   **Answer:** Angular Universal is a technology that allows Angular applications to be rendered on the server side. This server-side rendering (SSR) improves the performance of the application, especially on slow networks, and makes the application more SEO-friendly by serving a fully rendered page to the search engine bots.

### 19. **What is Angular Ivy?**
   **Answer:** Angular Ivy is the new rendering engine introduced in Angular 9. It is designed to be smaller, faster, and easier to use compared to the previous View Engine. Ivy enables several improvements, such as better debugging, smaller bundle sizes, and more efficient change detection.

### 20. **What is AOT compilation in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation in Angular is the process of compiling your Angular application and its templates during the build process, before the browser downloads and runs the code. AOT improves performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript to be parsed and by detecting template errors earlier in the development process.

### Angular Interview Questions and Answers (21-30)

#### 21. **What is Change Detection in Angular?**
   - **Answer:** Change detection in Angular is the process by which the framework determines whether the state of the application has changed and updates the view accordingly. Angular uses two types of change detection strategies:
     1. **Default:** The change detection runs for every component in the component tree.
     2. **OnPush:** The change detection runs only when the componentâ€™s input properties change, making it more performant for large applications.

#### 22. **Explain the concept of AOT compilation in Angular.**
   - **Answer:** AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation is a process where the Angular compiler converts the Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code before the browser downloads and runs it. This process leads to faster rendering, smaller Angular framework download sizes, and detects template errors earlier.

#### 23. **What is the difference between `ngOnInit()` and a constructor in Angular?**
   - **Answer:** The `constructor` is a TypeScript feature used for initializing class members and dependency injection. `ngOnInit()` is an Angular lifecycle hook that is called after Angular has initialized the component's data-bound properties. Unlike the constructor, `ngOnInit()` is a better place for initialization logic that depends on Angular bindings.

#### 24. **What is the purpose of Angular Services?**
   - **Answer:** Services in Angular are used to encapsulate reusable logic or functionalities that can be shared across different components. They help keep the code modular, maintainable, and testable. Common use cases for services include fetching data from APIs, logging, and utility functions.

#### 25. **What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular?**
   - **Answer:** Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Angular to pass dependencies (services or objects) into a class. Angular's DI system allows services to be injected into components, services, and other services, making it easier to manage dependencies and enhancing code reusability.

#### 26. **Explain the use of `@Input()` and `@Output()` in Angular.**
   - **Answer:** 
     - **`@Input()`** is a decorator that allows data to be passed from a parent component to a child component. It is used to bind a property in the child component to a property in the parent component.
     - **`@Output()`** is a decorator that allows a child component to emit events to the parent component. It is used to create custom events that a parent component can listen to and respond to.

#### 27. **What is a `Subject` in Angular, and how is it different from `Observable`?**
   - **Answer:** A `Subject` is a special type of `Observable` that allows values to be multicasted to multiple observers. Unlike a regular `Observable`, which is unicast and only emits to one subscriber, a `Subject` can emit values to many subscribers at once. `Subjects` are often used in Angular to share data between components.

#### 28. **What are Angular Pipes, and how are they used?**
   - **Answer:** Pipes in Angular are a way to transform data in the template before displaying it to the user. Angular provides several built-in pipes, such as `DatePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, and `UpperCasePipe`. Custom pipes can also be created to handle specific transformations.

#### 29. **How does Angular handle forms, and what are the differences between Template-driven and Reactive forms?**
   - **Answer:** Angular provides two ways to handle forms:
     1. **Template-driven forms:** These are forms where logic is defined using Angular directives in the template (e.g., `ngModel`). They are easier to work with but less scalable for complex forms.
     2. **Reactive forms:** These forms are more flexible and scalable, where the form model is defined in the component class using `FormControl` and `FormGroup`. Reactive forms are better suited for dynamic and complex form requirements.

#### 30. **What is `ng-content` in Angular?**
   - **Answer:** `ng-content` is a directive used to project content from a parent component into a child component. It allows the parent component to pass HTML content to the child component and enables the child component to display that content at a specific location within its template.

Here are more Angular interview questions and answers starting from number 31:

### 31. What is Angular CLI, and what are its benefits?
**Answer:**  
Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that provides a command-line interface for creating, building, and maintaining Angular applications. It helps in streamlining the development process by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency across projects, and enforcing best practices.

**Benefits of Angular CLI:**
- **Project Initialization:** Quickly set up a new Angular project with best practices and a predefined structure using `ng new`.
- **Code Generation:** Generate components, services, modules, pipes, directives, etc., using commands like `ng generate`.
- **Development Server:** Easily start a development server with live-reloading using `ng serve`.
- **Building and Bundling:** Efficiently build the project for different environments (e.g., development, production) with commands like `ng build`.
- **Testing:** Run unit tests and end-to-end tests with `ng test` and `ng e2e`.
- **Linting:** Enforce coding standards using `ng lint`.
- **Updates:** Keep Angular dependencies up to date with `ng update`.

### 32. What are Angular Directives? Explain the types.
**Answer:**  
Angular Directives are special markers in the DOM that tell Angular to do something with a DOM element or its children. They are used to manipulate the DOM and add dynamic behavior to elements.

**Types of Directives:**
1. **Structural Directives:** 
   - Change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.
   - Examples: `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`.

2. **Attribute Directives:** 
   - Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
   - Examples: `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, `ngModel`.

3. **Custom Directives:** 
   - Developers can create custom directives to encapsulate common DOM manipulation or behavior.
   - Example: A directive that changes the background color of an element on hover.

### 33. What is Dependency Injection in Angular?
**Answer:**  
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Angular to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows dependencies (such as services) to be injected into a component or service, rather than being created by the component or service itself.

**Advantages of DI in Angular:**
- **Decoupling:** Promotes loose coupling between components and their dependencies.
- **Testability:** Makes it easier to mock dependencies during unit testing.
- **Reusability:** Allows services to be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Configuration:** Services can be configured and swapped easily without changing the components that use them.

### 34. How does Angular handle forms, and what are the two types of forms in Angular?
**Answer:**  
Angular provides a robust way to handle forms, which are essential in collecting and validating user input. Angular supports two types of forms:

1. **Template-Driven Forms:**
   - Built using directives and bindings in the template.
   - Simple and suitable for basic forms.
   - Uses Angular directives like `ngModel` for two-way data binding.
   - Validation is defined in the template.

   ```html
   <form #form="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(form)">
     <input name="username" ngModel required>
     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

2. **Reactive Forms:**
   - Built programmatically in the component class.
   - More powerful and suitable for complex forms.
   - Uses `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `FormArray` for managing form state.
   - Validation logic is defined in the component class.

   ```typescript
   import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

   this.myForm = new FormGroup({
     username: new FormControl(''),
   });
   ```

### 35. What is Lazy Loading in Angular?
**Answer:**  
Lazy Loading in Angular is a technique used to load feature modules asynchronously when the user navigates to a route that requires them. It helps in reducing the initial load time of the application by loading only the necessary modules at the start and deferring the loading of other modules until they are needed.

**Implementation:**
- Define routes with the `loadChildren` property to specify the path to the module.
- Use Angular's built-in router to handle lazy loading.

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'feature',
    loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule)
  }
];
```

### 36. What are Angular Modules, and how are they used?
**Answer:**  
Angular Modules (`@NgModule`) are containers that group related components, directives, pipes, and services together. They help in organizing the application into cohesive blocks of functionality.

**Key Features of Angular Modules:**
- **Root Module:** The main module that bootstraps the Angular application (usually `AppModule`).
- **Feature Modules:** Modules that focus on specific areas of the application (e.g., `UserModule`, `AdminModule`).
- **Shared Module:** A module containing shared components, directives, and pipes that are used across multiple modules.
- **Core Module:** A module that contains singleton services and is imported only once in the root module.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, HeaderComponent, FooterComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 37. What is Change Detection in Angular, and how does it work?
**Answer:**  
Change Detection in Angular is a mechanism that tracks changes in the state of components and updates the DOM accordingly. Angular uses a change detection mechanism to ensure that the view is always synchronized with the model.

**How it works:**
- Angular creates a tree of components, each associated with a change detector.
- When a change occurs (e.g., user input, HTTP request, timer), Angular runs the change detection cycle to update the DOM.
- Angular can use two strategies for change detection:
  - **Default:** Checks every component for changes.
  - **OnPush:** Checks only components with changed inputs.

### 38. What are Angular Pipes, and how do you create a custom pipe?
**Answer:**  
Angular Pipes are functions that transform data in templates. They take input data, transform it, and return the transformed data to the template. Pipes are used for formatting, filtering, or manipulating data.

**Built-in Pipes:**
- `DatePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe`, etc.

**Creating a Custom Pipe:**
1. Create a new class and implement the `PipeTransform` interface.
2. Decorate the class with the `@Pipe` decorator, specifying the pipe name.
3. Implement the `transform()` method, which will contain the transformation logic.

```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'customPipe'
})
export class CustomPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

### 39. What is Angular Universal, and why is it used?
**Answer:**  
Angular Universal is a technology that allows Angular applications to be rendered on the server-side, providing server-side rendering (SSR). It generates static HTML on the server, which is sent to the client, enhancing performance and SEO.

**Benefits of Angular Universal:**
- **Faster Initial Load:** Since the HTML is pre-rendered on the server, the application appears faster to the user.
- **Improved SEO:** Search engines can index the content more easily because the content is available in the initial HTML response.
- **Better Performance on Slow Networks:** Reduces the time to first paint (TTFP) by sending pre-rendered HTML to the client.

### 40. What are Angular Animations, and how are they implemented?
**Answer:**  
Angular Animations allow developers to create complex animations within Angular applications. Angular provides a powerful API for defining and triggering animations.

**How to implement Angular Animations:**
1. Import the `BrowserAnimationsModule` in the `AppModule`.
2. Define animations in the component using the `@Component` decorator or in a separate file.
3. Use Angular's animation DSL to define states, transitions, triggers, and keyframes.

```typescript
import { trigger, state, style, transition, animate } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-animate',
  templateUrl: './animate.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./animate.component.css'],
  animations: [
    trigger('openClose', [
      state('open', style({ height: '200px', opacity: 1 })),
      state('closed', style({ height: '100px', opacity: 0.5 })),
      transition('open <=> closed', [animate('0.5s')]),
    ])
  ]
})
export class AnimateComponent {
  isOpen = true;

  toggle() {
    this.isOpen = !this.isOpen;
  }
}
```

### Angular Interview Questions and Answers (Starting from 41)

---

**41. What is the purpose of `ng-content` in Angular?**

`ng-content` is used to project content into Angular components. It allows you to create components that can receive HTML content from the parent component and project it into the child component. This is useful when creating reusable components like modals, tabs, or cards, where you want the ability to customize the content.

```html
<!-- Parent Component -->
<app-card>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Description goes here.</p>
</app-card>

<!-- Child Component -->
<div class="card">
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
```

---

**42. What is Angular's Dependency Injection (DI) system?**

Angular's Dependency Injection (DI) system is a design pattern used to implement inversion of control for resolving dependencies. DI allows you to inject services or dependencies into a component, directive, or service, rather than hard-coding them into the component. This makes the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() {}
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
}
```

---

**43. How do you create a custom directive in Angular?**

A custom directive in Angular is created using the `@Directive` decorator. Directives are used to add behavior to elements in the DOM. There are two types of directives: structural directives and attribute directives.

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2, HostListener } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]',
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef, private renderer: Renderer2) {}

  @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {
    this.renderer.setStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'backgroundColor', 'yellow');
  }

  @HostListener('mouseleave') onMouseLeave() {
    this.renderer.removeStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'backgroundColor');
  }
}
```

---

**44. What are Angular lifecycle hooks?**

Angular lifecycle hooks are methods that are invoked at specific stages of a component's lifecycle. They allow you to perform custom logic during the creation, update, and destruction of components.

Some commonly used lifecycle hooks include:

- `ngOnInit()`: Called once, after the component's first display.
- `ngOnChanges()`: Called when any data-bound property of a directive changes.
- `ngOnDestroy()`: Called just before the component is destroyed.
- `ngAfterViewInit()`: Called after the view and child views have been initialized.

---

**45. What is the difference between `@ViewChild()` and `@ContentChild()`?**

- `@ViewChild()`: This decorator is used to access a child component, directive, or DOM element from the view (template) of the current component. It is used to manipulate the DOM or get access to the underlying element/component after the view has been initialized.

- `@ContentChild()`: This decorator is used to access projected content (i.e., content that is passed from a parent component) within a child component. It is used to interact with elements or components that are passed into the component's content projection.

---

**46. What is the Angular Router, and how does it work?**

The Angular Router is a powerful tool that enables navigation between different views or pages in an Angular application. It maps URLs to components, allowing users to navigate through the app by changing the URL.

The Angular Router works by configuring routes in the `RouterModule` and associating them with components. When the user navigates to a particular route, the router loads the associated component.

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

---

**47. How can you implement lazy loading in Angular?**

Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load modules only when they are needed, rather than loading them upfront. This can significantly improve the initial load time of your application.

To implement lazy loading:

1. Create a module for the feature you want to lazy load.
2. Use the `loadChildren` property in the route configuration.

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'feature',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./feature/feature.module').then((m) => m.FeatureModule),
  },
];
```

---

**48. What is an Angular service, and how do you create one?**

An Angular service is a class that encapsulates business logic, data, or both and can be shared across components. Services are typically used to perform tasks like HTTP requests, data manipulation, or shared state management.

You can create a service using the Angular CLI:

```bash
ng generate service my-service
```

This command generates a service file with a basic structure:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() {}
}
```

---

**49. What is Angular's `HttpClientModule`, and how do you use it?**

`HttpClientModule` is a module in Angular that provides a simplified API for making HTTP requests to a backend server. It is built on top of the browser's native `fetch` API and is used for tasks like getting data, posting data, and handling responses.

To use `HttpClientModule`:

1. Import `HttpClientModule` into your `AppModule`.
2. Inject `HttpClient` into your service or component.

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getData() {
    return this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  }
}
```

---

**50. What are Angular pipes, and how do you create a custom pipe?**

Angular pipes are a way to transform data in templates. They take in a value and return a formatted value. Angular provides several built-in pipes like `date`, `uppercase`, and `currency`. You can also create custom pipes.

To create a custom pipe:

1. Use the `@Pipe` decorator.
2. Implement the `PipeTransform` interface.

```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'capitalize',
})
export class CapitalizePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1);
  }
}
```

Use the custom pipe in your template:

```html
<p>{{ 'hello world' | capitalize }}</p>
```

### Angular Interview Questions and Answers (Starting from 51)

---

**51. What is the purpose of the `Renderer2` service in Angular?**

`Renderer2` is a service in Angular that provides a way to manipulate the DOM in a platform-agnostic way. This is particularly useful for web workers, server-side rendering, or any environment where direct access to the DOM is not possible or recommended.

The `Renderer2` service provides methods to create elements, set attributes, listen to events, and more, without directly interacting with the DOM API.

```typescript
import { Component, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<div>Example</div>',
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    const div = this.renderer.createElement('div');
    this.renderer.setStyle(div, 'color', 'blue');
    const text = this.renderer.createText('Hello, world!');
    this.renderer.appendChild(div, text);
    this.renderer.appendChild(document.body, div);
  }
}
```

---

**52. How does Angular handle two-way data binding?**

Angular uses a combination of property binding and event binding to implement two-way data binding. This is achieved using the `[(ngModel)]` directive, which binds the input element to a component property and listens for changes to update the model.

```html
<input [(ngModel)]="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
<p>Your name is: {{ name }}</p>
```

In this example, when the user types into the input field, the `name` property in the component is automatically updated, and the updated value is reflected in the paragraph.

---

**53. What is the difference between `NgModel` and `FormControl` in Angular?**

- `NgModel`: It is used for template-driven forms and provides a way to bind form controls in the template to data in the component. It is easy to use and requires minimal configuration, but it offers less control over form validation and state management.

- `FormControl`: It is part of Angular's reactive forms and provides more control over form state and validation. `FormControl` allows you to define form controls programmatically and manage their validation and state directly in the component.

```typescript
// Using FormControl in a reactive form
import { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

export class MyComponent {
  name = new FormControl('');
}
```

```html
<!-- Template for FormControl -->
<input [formControl]="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
```

---

**54. How do you implement route guards in Angular?**

Route guards are used to control access to certain routes based on specific conditions, such as authentication or permissions. Angular provides several types of route guards: `CanActivate`, `CanActivateChild`, `CanDeactivate`, `Resolve`, and `CanLoad`.

To implement a route guard:

1. Create a service that implements the `CanActivate` interface.
2. Implement the `canActivate` method to return `true` or `false` based on your conditions.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, Router } from '@angular/router';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private router: Router) {}

  canActivate(): boolean {
    const isAuthenticated = // check authentication logic;
    if (isAuthenticated) {
      return true;
    } else {
      this.router.navigate(['/login']);
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Apply the guard to a route
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] },
];
```

**55. What are Angular animations, and how do you implement them?**

Angular animations are used to create motion and visual effects in Angular applications. The `@angular/animations` package provides a way to define animations in a declarative manner.

To implement animations:

1. Import the `BrowserAnimationsModule` into your `AppModule`.
2. Define animations using the `trigger`, `state`, `style`, `animate`, and `transition` functions.

```typescript
import { trigger, state, style, transition, animate } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<div [@fadeInOut]></div>',
  animations: [
    trigger('fadeInOut', [
      state('void', style({ opacity: 0 })),
      transition(':enter, :leave', [
        animate(3000)
      ]),
    ]),
  ],
})
export class ExampleComponent {}
```

In this example, the `fadeInOut` animation is triggered when the element enters or leaves the DOM.

---

**56. What is the purpose of `ng-template` in Angular?**

`ng-template` is an Angular directive used to define a template that is not rendered by default but can be instantiated and rendered later using structural directives like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, or the `ngTemplateOutlet` directive. It is commonly used for reusable templates, content projection, and dynamic component rendering.

```html
<ng-template #myTemplate>
  <p>This is a reusable template.</p>
</ng-template>

<div *ngIf="show" [ngTemplateOutlet]="myTemplate"></div>
```

In this example, the content inside `ng-template` will only be rendered when the condition in `*ngIf` is true.

---

**57. How do you handle errors globally in Angular?**

Angular provides the `ErrorHandler` class for global error handling. You can create a custom error handler by extending the `ErrorHandler` class and overriding the `handleError` method.

```typescript
import { ErrorHandler, Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class GlobalErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: any): void {
    // Handle the error here (e.g., log it, show a notification)
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  }
}
```

To use this global error handler, provide it in the `AppModule`:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  providers: [{ provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: GlobalErrorHandler }],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

---

**58. What is the role of `ngZone` in Angular?**

`ngZone` is a service in Angular that helps manage and control the change detection mechanism. It allows you to run code inside or outside of Angular's zone, which can help improve performance by reducing unnecessary change detection cycles.

Common use cases for `ngZone` include running heavy computations or third-party code outside Angular's zone to prevent excessive change detection.

```typescript
import { Component, NgZone } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<p>{{ counter }}</p>',
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  counter = 0;

  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {
    this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
      setInterval(() => {
        this.counter++;
        // Explicitly trigger change detection if needed
        this.ngZone.run(() => {});
      }, 1000);
    });
  }
}
```

---

**59. What are Angular directives, and what are the types?**

Angular directives are special markers in the DOM that tell Angular to attach a specific behavior to the element or modify its appearance, behavior, or layout.

There are three types of directives in Angular:

1. **Component Directives**: These are directives with a template. They create reusable views with associated behavior. Components are the most common type of directive.

2. **Structural Directives**: These directives change the DOM layout by adding or removing elements. Examples include `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `*ngSwitch`.

3. **Attribute Directives**: These directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. Examples include `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, and custom attribute directives.

---

**60. How can you share data between sibling components in Angular?**

To share data between sibling components (components that do not have a direct parent-child relationship), you can use a shared service. The service acts as a mediator and stores the data that needs to be shared. Both components can inject the service and access the shared data.

1. Create a shared service.
2. Inject the service into both sibling components.
3. Use the service to get or set shared data.

```typescript
// Shared service
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class SharedService {
  private data = new BehaviorSubject<string>('default data');
  sharedData = this.data.asObservable();

  setData(data: string) {
    this.data.next(data);
  }
}

// Sibling Component 1
@Component({
  selector: 'app-sibling1',
  template: '<button (click)="sendData()">Send Data</button>',
})
export class Sibling1Component {
  constructor(private sharedService: SharedService) {}

  sendData() {
    this.sharedService.setData('Data from Sibling 1');
  }
}

// Sibling Component 2
@Component({
  selector: 'app-sibling2',
  template: '<p>{{ data }}</p>',
})
export class Sibling2Component implements OnInit {
  data: string;

  constructor(private sharedService: SharedService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.sharedService.sharedData.subscribe((data) => {
      this.data = data;
    });
  }
}
```

### Angular Interview Questions and Answers (Starting from 61)

---

**61. What is the purpose of `ng-content` in Angular?**

`ng-content` is used for content projection in Angular, allowing you to pass and display content within a component from outside the component. It acts as a placeholder for the projected content, enabling developers to create reusable components with customizable content.

```typescript
// Parent Component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `<app-child><p>Projected Content</p></app-child>`,
})
export class ParentComponent {}

// Child Component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<div><ng-content></ng-content></div>`,
})
export class ChildComponent {}
```

In this example, the `<p>Projected Content</p>` inside the `app-child` component is projected into the `ng-content` placeholder.

---

**62. How do you optimize Angular applications for better performance?**

Optimizing Angular applications involves several strategies, including:

1. **OnPush Change Detection**: Use `OnPush` strategy to reduce unnecessary change detection cycles.
   
   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-optimized',
     changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
     template: `<p>{{ data }}</p>`,
   })
   export class OptimizedComponent {
     @Input() data: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Lazy Loading Modules**: Load modules only when needed to reduce the initial bundle size.
   
   ```typescript
   const routes: Routes = [
     { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) },
   ];
   ```

3. **Tree Shaking**: Ensure that unused code is removed during the build process by using Angular's AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation.

4. **Use Pure Pipes**: Pure pipes only execute when their inputs change, reducing unnecessary calculations.

5. **Avoid Memory Leaks**: Use `ngOnDestroy` to clean up subscriptions and avoid memory leaks.

---

**63. What are Angular lifecycle hooks, and why are they important?**

Angular lifecycle hooks are methods that allow you to tap into different stages of a component's lifecycle, such as initialization, changes, and destruction. They are important for managing component behavior, such as fetching data, cleaning up resources, or handling input changes.

Key lifecycle hooks include:

1. **ngOnInit**: Called once after the component is initialized. Commonly used for fetching data.

2. **ngOnChanges**: Called whenever input properties change. Useful for reacting to changes in input values.

3. **ngDoCheck**: Called during every change detection run. Allows custom change detection logic.

4. **ngOnDestroy**: Called just before the component is destroyed. Used for cleanup tasks, such as unsubscribing from Observables.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-lifecycle',
  template: '<p>Lifecycle Hook Example</p>',
})
export class LifecycleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Component Initialized');
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('Component Destroyed');
  }
}
```

---

**64. What is a `HostBinding` and how is it used in Angular?**

`HostBinding` is a decorator in Angular that allows you to bind properties or attributes of the host element (the element on which the directive or component is applied) to a property in the directive or component class.

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]',
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  @HostBinding('style.backgroundColor') backgroundColor: string;

  constructor() {
    this.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
  }
}
```

In this example, the `@HostBinding` decorator binds the `backgroundColor` style of the host element to the `backgroundColor` property in the directive, highlighting the element with a yellow background.

---

**65. What is the `async` pipe and how does it work in Angular?**

The `async` pipe is a built-in Angular pipe that subscribes to an Observable or a Promise and returns the latest value emitted by the Observable or resolved by the Promise. It automatically handles subscription and unsubscription, making it ideal for working with asynchronous data in templates.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-async-pipe',
  template: `<p>{{ observableData$ | async }}</p>`,
})
export class AsyncPipeComponent {
  observableData$ = of('Hello, World!');
}
```

In this example, the `async` pipe subscribes to the `observableData$` Observable and displays its emitted value in the template.

---

**66. How does Angular handle forms? Explain template-driven and reactive forms.**

Angular provides two approaches for building forms:

1. **Template-driven forms**: These forms are defined directly in the template using directives like `ngModel`, `ngForm`, and `ngModelGroup`. They are easier to set up but offer less control over validation and form state.

   ```html
   <form #form="ngForm">
     <input [(ngModel)]="name" name="name" required>
     <button type="submit" [disabled]="form.invalid">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

2. **Reactive forms**: These forms are defined and managed in the component class using `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormBuilder`. They provide more control over form validation, state, and dynamic form creation.

   ```typescript
   this.form = this.fb.group({
     name: ['', Validators.required],
   });
   ```

   ```html
   <form [formGroup]="form">
     <input formControlName="name">
     <button type="submit" [disabled]="form.invalid">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

---

**67. What is the `Injector` in Angular, and how does it work?**

The `Injector` in Angular is a core service that is responsible for creating and injecting dependencies into components, directives, pipes, and services. The injector maintains a container of providers and can instantiate services based on the provided configuration.

When a class is decorated with `@Injectable`, Angular's dependency injection system knows how to create instances of that class and inject them where needed.

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() {}
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<p>Example Component</p>`,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
}
```

In this example, `MyService` is injected into `ExampleComponent` through the constructor.

---

**68. What is the difference between `@Injectable` and `@Inject` in Angular?**

- **`@Injectable`**: This decorator is used to define a service that can be injected into other classes. It indicates that the class is eligible for dependency injection.

- **`@Inject`**: This decorator is used to specify the exact dependency to inject when Angular cannot infer the dependency type. It is useful when injecting dependencies that require tokens or when the type cannot be determined automatically.

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() {}
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<p>Example Component</p>`,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(MyService) private service) {}
}
```

In this example, `@Inject` is used to specify that `MyService` should be injected into the component.

---

**69. What are Angular zones and how do they work?**

Angular zones, managed by the `Zone.js` library, are a mechanism to track asynchronous operations and automatically trigger change detection when these operations complete. Zones wrap asynchronous events like promises, setTimeout, or HTTP requests, ensuring that Angular knows when to update the view.

Zones are particularly useful for managing change detection efficiently and for tracking the execution context of asynchronous operations.

```typescript
import { Component, NgZone } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-zone-example',
  template: '<p>{{ counter }}</p>',
})
export class ZoneExampleComponent {
  counter = 0;

  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {
    this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
      setInterval(() => {
        this.counter++;
        this.ngZone.run(() => {}); // Run inside Angular zone to trigger change detection
      }, 1000);
    });
  }
}
```

---

**70. What is the purpose of Angular's `ViewEncapsulation`, and what are its modes?**

`ViewEncapsulation` is an Angular mechanism that controls how styles are encapsulated and applied to components. Angular provides three modes of view encapsulation:

1. **Emulated** (default): Emulates Shadow DOM by adding unique attributes to component elements. Styles are scoped to the component but not to the entire document.

2. **Shadow DOM**: Uses native Shadow DOM to encapsulate styles, providing true style isolation. Only supported in browsers with Shadow DOM support.

3. **None**: No style encapsulation. Styles are applied globally to the entire document.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-encapsulation',
  template: `<p>Encapsulation Example</p>`,
  styles: ['p { color: red; }'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated, // Default
})
export class EncapsulationComponent {}
```

In this example, the paragraph's styles will only apply to elements within the component due to the `Emulated` view encapsulation.

### Angular Interview Questions and Answers (Starting from 71)

---

**71. What are Angular directives, and how do they differ from components?**

Angular directives are special classes that extend or modify the behavior of elements in the DOM. There are three types of directives:

1. **Components**: Directives with a template. They are the most common type of directive and represent a view in Angular.
   
   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-example',
     template: '<p>Component Example</p>',
   })
   export class ExampleComponent {}
   ```

2. **Attribute Directives**: Modify the behavior or appearance of an existing element, component, or directive. An example is `ngClass`.

   ```typescript
   @Directive({
     selector: '[appHighlight]',
   })
   export class HighlightDirective {
     constructor(private el: ElementRef) {
       el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Structural Directives**: Modify the DOM structure by adding or removing elements. Examples include `ngIf` and `ngFor`.

   ```typescript
   <div *ngIf="condition">This will display if the condition is true.</div>
   ```

**Components** are a specialized form of directives with their own template, styles, and encapsulation. In contrast, **attribute** and **structural directives** do not have templates and are used to enhance existing elements.

---

**72. What is Angular Universal, and why is it important?**

Angular Universal is a technology that allows Angular applications to be rendered on the server side. It provides server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, which improves performance and search engine optimization (SEO) for Angular applications.

**Benefits of Angular Universal:**

1. **Faster Initial Load**: Server-side rendering delivers the fully rendered page to the client, leading to a faster initial load.

2. **Improved SEO**: Search engines can better index the server-rendered content, improving the website's SEO.

3. **Better Performance on Low-end Devices**: Since the heavy lifting is done on the server, the client device can render the content more efficiently.

To implement Angular Universal:

1. Install the `@nguniversal/express-engine` package.
   
   ```bash
   ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
   ```

2. Generate the Universal project files and configurations.

3. Build and run the server-side application.

---

**73. What is lazy loading, and how is it implemented in Angular?**

Lazy loading is an optimization technique where modules or components are loaded on-demand rather than at the initial application load. In Angular, lazy loading is primarily used to load feature modules only when the user navigates to a route that requires them.

**Implementation:**

1. Create a feature module (e.g., `FeatureModule`).
   
   ```typescript
   @NgModule({
     declarations: [FeatureComponent],
     imports: [CommonModule],
   })
   export class FeatureModule {}
   ```

2. Use the `loadChildren` method in the router configuration to define a route for lazy loading.
   
   ```typescript
   const routes: Routes = [
     {
       path: 'feature',
       loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule),
     },
   ];
   ```

When the user navigates to the `/feature` route, Angular will load the `FeatureModule` on demand.

---

**74. What are resolvers in Angular, and how do they work?**

Resolvers in Angular are used to perform data fetching before a route is activated. They ensure that necessary data is available before the component is rendered. Resolvers are typically used to fetch data from a server or perform any asynchronous task required by the component.

**Implementation:**

1. Create a resolver service implementing the `Resolve` interface.

   ```typescript
   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root',
   })
   export class DataResolver implements Resolve<any> {
     constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

     resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<any> {
       return this.dataService.getData();
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add the resolver to the route configuration.

   ```typescript
   const routes: Routes = [
     {
       path: 'data',
       component: DataComponent,
       resolve: { data: DataResolver },
     },
   ];
   ```

3. Access the resolved data in the component.

   ```typescript
   export class DataComponent implements OnInit {
     constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

     ngOnInit() {
       this.route.data.subscribe((data: { data: any }) => {
         console.log(data.data);
       });
     }
   }
   ```

---

**75. How does Angular handle errors, and what is the `ErrorHandler` class?**

Angular provides a global mechanism to handle errors using the `ErrorHandler` class. The `ErrorHandler` class can be extended to create custom error-handling logic that applies throughout the application.

**Implementation:**

1. Create a custom error handler by extending the `ErrorHandler` class.

   ```typescript
   @Injectable()
   export class GlobalErrorHandler extends ErrorHandler {
     handleError(error: any): void {
       // Custom error handling logic
       console.error('An error occurred:', error);
       super.handleError(error);
     }
   }
   ```

2. Provide the custom error handler in the application module.

   ```typescript
   @NgModule({
     providers: [{ provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: GlobalErrorHandler }],
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

Now, any error that occurs in the application will be handled by the `GlobalErrorHandler`, where you can log the error, display notifications, or send the error to a server.

---

**76. What is Angular Material, and how is it used in Angular applications?**

Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular, following the Material Design guidelines by Google. It provides a collection of reusable and accessible components such as buttons, forms, navigation, and layout components.

**Implementation:**

1. Install Angular Material and add it to your project.

   ```bash
   ng add @angular/material
   ```

2. Import the required modules in your Angular module.

   ```typescript
   import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
   import { MatInputModule } from '@angular/material/input';

   @NgModule({
     imports: [MatButtonModule, MatInputModule],
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

3. Use Angular Material components in your templates.

   ```html
   <button mat-button>Click me</button>
   <mat-form-field>
     <input matInput placeholder="Enter your name">
   </mat-form-field>
   ```

Angular Material simplifies the development of responsive, consistent, and visually appealing user interfaces in Angular applications.

---

**77. What is the purpose of the `Renderer2` class in Angular?**

The `Renderer2` class in Angular is an abstraction used to manipulate DOM elements in a way that is compatible across different platforms (e.g., web, native mobile). It provides a safe way to perform DOM manipulations like setting styles, attributes, or listening to events.

**Key Methods:**

- `setStyle`: Applies a CSS style to an element.
- `removeStyle`: Removes a CSS style from an element.
- `addClass`: Adds a class to an element.
- `removeClass`: Removes a class from an element.
- `setAttribute`: Sets an attribute on an element.
- `removeAttribute`: Removes an attribute from an element.
- `listen`: Adds an event listener to an element.

**Example:**

```typescript
import { Component, Renderer2, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-renderer-example',
  template: `<button (click)="changeColor()">Change Color</button>`,
})
export class RendererExampleComponent {
  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private el: ElementRef) {}

  changeColor() {
    this.renderer.setStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'color', 'red');
  }
}
```

Using `Renderer2` ensures that the code is compatible with different rendering environments, like server-side rendering with Angular Universal.

---

**78. How do you implement routing guards in Angular?**

Routing guards in Angular are services that control navigation to and from routes based on certain conditions. There are several types of guards:

1. **CanActivate**: Prevents unauthorized access to a route.
2. **CanDeactivate**: Prevents navigation away from a route under certain conditions.
3. **CanActivateChild**: Applies to child routes, similar to `CanActivate`.
4. **Resolve**: Pre-fetches data before a route is activated.
5. **CanLoad**: Prevents loading lazy-loaded modules under certain conditions.

**Example: Implementing `CanActivate` Guard:**

1. Create a guard service implementing the `CanActivate` interface.

   ```typescript
   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root',
   })
   export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
     constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) {}

     canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean {
       if (this.authService.isLoggedIn()) {
         return true;
       } else {
         this.router.navigate(['login']);
         return false;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Apply the guard to a route.

   ```typescript
   const routes: Routes = [
     {
       path: 'dashboard',
       component: DashboardComponent,
       canActivate: [AuthGuard],
     },
   ];
   ```
