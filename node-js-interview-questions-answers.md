Certainly! Here’s a list of Node.js interview questions along with their answers, which can help you prepare for your interviews.

### 1. **What is Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications.

### 2. **What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?**
   **Answer:**  
   JavaScript is a programming language typically used for client-side scripting in web browsers. Node.js, on the other hand, is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser, primarily on the server-side.

### 3. **Explain the concept of event-driven programming in Node.js.**
   **Answer:**  
   Node.js uses an event-driven architecture where the flow of the program is determined by events. Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop, where an event triggers a callback function. This model is particularly efficient for I/O operations, allowing Node.js to handle many concurrent connections without threading.

### 4. **What is the role of the event loop in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   The event loop is central to Node.js's non-blocking, asynchronous nature. It continuously checks the event queue and processes callbacks. If there is no I/O or a timer waiting, the loop continues to check for events. This allows Node.js to handle multiple operations without creating multiple threads.

### 5. **What are the different types of modules in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   There are three types of modules in Node.js:
   - **Core Modules:** These are built-in modules that come with Node.js (e.g., `fs`, `http`, `path`).
   - **Local Modules:** These are user-defined modules that reside in separate files within your project.
   - **Third-Party Modules:** These are modules installed using npm (Node Package Manager) like `express`, `lodash`, etc.

### 6. **How do you handle asynchronous operations in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Asynchronous operations in Node.js can be handled using:
   - **Callbacks:** Functions passed as arguments to be executed once an asynchronous operation completes.
   - **Promises:** Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, allowing chaining of asynchronous calls.
   - **Async/Await:** Syntactic sugar built on top of promises that allows you to write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous.

### 7. **What is a callback hell? How can you avoid it?**
   **Answer:**  
   Callback hell refers to a situation where multiple nested callbacks make the code difficult to read and maintain. It can be avoided by:
   - **Modularizing code:** Breaking code into smaller, reusable functions.
   - **Using Promises:** Replacing nested callbacks with `.then()` chaining.
   - **Using Async/Await:** Writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion.

### 8. **What is `npm`?**
   **Answer:**  
   npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, manage, and share packages of reusable code and also manage dependencies in a project.

### 9. **Explain the use of `package.json` in Node.js projects.**
   **Answer:**  
   `package.json` is a file that contains metadata about the Node.js project. It includes information like the project’s name, version, dependencies, scripts, and more. It is crucial for defining and managing the project’s dependencies.

### 10. **What are streams in Node.js, and why are they important?**
    **Answer:**  
    Streams are instances of EventEmitter that allow you to work with streaming data in Node.js. They are important because they enable efficient reading and writing of data, particularly with large files, by processing data piece-by-piece rather than loading everything into memory at once. There are four types of streams:
   - **Readable:** Allows you to read data sequentially.
   - **Writable:** Allows you to write data sequentially.
   - **Duplex:** Streams that are both readable and writable.
   - **Transform:** Streams that can modify or transform the data as it is read or written.

### 11. **How does Node.js handle child processes?**
    **Answer:**  
    Node.js provides the `child_process` module to create and manage child processes. There are four main methods:
   - **spawn():** Starts a new process and streams its output.
   - **exec():** Executes a command in a shell and buffers the output.
   - **execFile():** Similar to `exec()` but does not spawn a shell.
   - **fork():** Special case of spawn used to create new Node.js processes and communicate with them via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

### 12. **What is the purpose of middleware in Node.js?**
    **Answer:**  
    Middleware in Node.js (specifically in frameworks like Express) is a function that receives the request and response objects, processes the request, and either sends a response or passes control to the next middleware function. Middleware is used for logging, authentication, error handling, and more.

### 13. **How do you handle errors in Node.js?**
    **Answer:**  
    Error handling in Node.js can be done using:
   - **Callbacks:** The first argument in callbacks is typically an error object, allowing you to check and handle errors.
   - **Try/Catch blocks:** Used with synchronous code or with async/await to handle exceptions.
   - **Event Emitters:** Objects that emit errors can be handled using `.on('error')`.
   - **Promises:** Use `.catch()` to handle errors in promises.

### 14. **What is clustering in Node.js, and why is it important?**
    **Answer:**  
    Clustering allows Node.js to utilize multiple CPU cores by creating child processes (workers) that share the same server port. This helps improve the scalability and performance of Node.js applications by allowing them to handle more concurrent connections.

### 15. **How do you manage environment variables in a Node.js application?**
    **Answer:**  
    Environment variables can be managed using the `process.env` object in Node.js. You can use libraries like `dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, making it easier to manage different environments (development, production, etc.) without hardcoding values in your application.

### 16. **What are the differences between `require` and `import` in Node.js?**
    **Answer:**  
    - **`require`:** CommonJS syntax, used in Node.js to load modules. It is synchronous and can be used anywhere in the code.
    - **`import`:** ES6 module syntax, which is asynchronous and must be used at the top of the file. ES6 modules are statically analyzed, and the `import` statement is part of the ES6 specification. `require` is older and more widely supported, but `import` is the future of JavaScript modules.

### 17. **What is the `Express.js` framework, and why is it used?**
    **Answer:**  
    Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies server creation, routing, handling requests and responses, and managing middleware, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs.

### 18. **Explain how to set up a simple Express server in Node.js.**
    **Answer:**  
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello, World!');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    ```
    This code sets up a basic Express server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" when the root URL is accessed.

### 19. **What are some common security practices in Node.js?**
    **Answer:**  
    - **Input validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
    - **Using HTTPS:** Encrypt data in transit by using HTTPS.
    - **Environment variables:** Store sensitive data like API keys and database credentials in environment variables.
    - **Rate limiting:** Limit the number of requests to prevent DDoS attacks.
    - **Authentication and Authorization:** Use strong authentication methods (e.g., JWT) and ensure proper authorization checks.

### 20. **How do you scale a Node.js application?**
    **Answer:**  
    - **Clustering:** Use the `cluster` module to take advantage of multi-core systems by running multiple Node.js processes.
    - **Load balancing:** Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers or processes using load balancers.
    - **Microservices:** Break down the application into smaller, independent services that can be scaled individually.
    - **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more instances of your application across multiple machines or containers.
    - **Caching:** Implement caching strategies using tools like Redis to reduce database load and improve performance.

These questions and answers cover a wide range of topics that can help you prepare for a Node.js interview.

Certainly! Here are more advanced Node.js interview questions and answers to further your preparation.

### 21. **What is the purpose of the `Buffer` class in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `Buffer` class in Node.js is used to handle binary data directly. It’s an important class because JavaScript typically handles strings and does not have a built-in type for binary data. Buffers allow you to work with binary data streams from files, networks, or other I/O sources.

### 22. **What are global objects in Node.js, and can you name a few?**
   **Answer:**  
   Global objects in Node.js are available in all modules without having to use `require()`. Some common global objects include:
   - **`global`:** The global namespace object.
   - **`process`:** Provides information and control over the current Node.js process.
   - **`__dirname`:** The directory name of the current module.
   - **`__filename`:** The filename of the current module.
   - **`setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, `clearTimeout()`, `clearInterval()`:** Timer functions.

### 23. **What is the difference between `readFileSync` and `readFile` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`readFileSync`:** Synchronous method that blocks the event loop until the file is read completely. It is used when you need to read a file in a blocking manner.
   - **`readFile`:** Asynchronous method that does not block the event loop. It takes a callback function that is executed when the file reading operation is complete.

### 24. **What is middleware chaining in Express.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Middleware chaining in Express.js refers to the ability to use multiple middleware functions sequentially. Each middleware function receives the `request`, `response`, and `next` objects. The `next` function is called to pass control to the next middleware in the chain. This pattern is useful for modularizing code, such as separating concerns for logging, authentication, and request handling.

### 25. **Explain how you would debug a Node.js application.**
   **Answer:**  
   Debugging a Node.js application can be done using several tools and methods:
   - **`console.log()`:** Basic logging to track the flow of the application and variable values.
   - **`node --inspect`:** Starts the Node.js application in debug mode, which can be connected to Chrome DevTools for stepping through code, inspecting variables, and setting breakpoints.
   - **Debugger:** Use the built-in `debugger` keyword in your code, which acts as a breakpoint.
   - **Logging libraries:** Using libraries like `winston` or `morgan` for more advanced logging.

### 26. **What is a worker thread in Node.js, and when would you use it?**
   **Answer:**  
   Worker threads are a way to run JavaScript code in parallel threads. They are useful for performing CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main event loop, such as data processing, cryptography, or complex computations. You can use the `worker_threads` module to create and manage worker threads.

### 27. **What are `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` caching strategies, and how do they apply to Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   These are HTTP caching strategies:
   - **`stale-while-revalidate`:** Allows serving stale content from the cache while asynchronously revalidating the cache in the background.
   - **`stale-if-error`:** Allows serving stale content from the cache if the origin server is unavailable or returns an error.
   In Node.js, these strategies can be implemented using reverse proxies (like Nginx), CDN configurations, or custom middleware to improve performance and availability.

### 28. **How do you manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single machine?**
   **Answer:**  
   Multiple versions of Node.js can be managed using tools like:
   - **nvm (Node Version Manager):** Allows you to install and switch between different Node.js versions easily.
   - **n**: Another version manager for Node.js that allows you to manage different versions.
   - **Docker containers:** Running different Node.js versions within separate containers.

### 29. **What is `CORS`, and how do you handle it in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows resources on a web server to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. In Node.js, you can handle CORS using the `cors` middleware in Express.js, which adds the necessary HTTP headers to enable cross-origin requests.

   ```javascript
   const cors = require('cors');
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.use(cors());
   ```

### 30. **How does Node.js handle memory management?**
   **Answer:**  
   Node.js handles memory management using the V8 engine, which implements garbage collection to automatically reclaim memory used by objects no longer in use. However, it’s important to be aware of potential memory leaks in long-running applications, such as those caused by unintentional global variables, event listeners not being removed, or excessive buffering of data in memory.

### 31. **What is `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   `process.nextTick()` is a function that defers the execution of a callback until the next iteration of the event loop. It is used to schedule a callback to be invoked before any I/O operations or timers in the current event loop, but after the current operation completes.

### 32. **What are some ways to improve the performance of a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **Use clustering:** Take advantage of multiple CPU cores using the `cluster` module.
   - **Implement caching:** Use in-memory caching (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data.
   - **Optimize database queries:** Use indexes and avoid expensive joins or subqueries.
   - **Use asynchronous methods:** Avoid blocking the event loop with synchronous methods.
   - **Stream large data:** Use streams to handle large data instead of reading/writing everything in memory.
   - **Optimize middleware usage:** Ensure middleware functions are lightweight and only included when necessary.

### 33. **How do you handle file uploads in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   File uploads in Node.js can be handled using middleware like `multer` in Express.js. It processes `multipart/form-data` (which is used for file uploads) and provides the file(s) in the `req.file` or `req.files` object.

   ```javascript
   const multer = require('multer');
   const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

   app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
     res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
   });
   ```

### 34. **What are some common use cases for Node.js streams?**
   **Answer:**  
   Node.js streams are commonly used for:
   - **Reading and writing files:** Streams can handle large files without loading them entirely into memory.
   - **Networking:** Processing incoming data from network requests (e.g., HTTP requests).
   - **Piping:** Connecting streams to pass data from one stream to another (e.g., reading a file and sending it directly to an HTTP response).
   - **Real-time data processing:** Processing data chunks as they arrive, useful in real-time applications.

### 35. **What are the different HTTP methods supported by Node.js, and what are they used for?**
   **Answer:**  
   Node.js (and Express.js) supports the following HTTP methods:
   - **GET:** Retrieve data from the server.
   - **POST:** Send data to the server to create or update a resource.
   - **PUT:** Update or replace a resource on the server.
   - **DELETE:** Remove a resource from the server.
   - **PATCH:** Apply partial modifications to a resource.
   - **OPTIONS:** Describe the communication options for the target resource.

### 36. **What is the purpose of `app.use()` in Express.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   `app.use()` is a method in Express.js that is used to mount middleware functions at a specified path. It can be used to apply middleware globally to all routes or specific paths, allowing for tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and more.

   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
     next();
   });
   ```

### 37. **What is the difference between `app.get()` and `app.post()` in Express.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`app.get()`:** Handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve data from the server. It typically retrieves data without causing any side effects on the server.
   - **`app.post()`:** Handles HTTP POST requests to send data to the server, usually to create a new resource or submit data.

Sure! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, continuing from number 38.

### 38. **What is the difference between `setImmediate()` and `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`setImmediate()`:** Schedules a callback to execute on the next iteration of the event loop, after the I/O events. It is useful for deferring execution until the current I/O operations have completed.
   - **`process.nextTick()`:** Schedules a callback to execute immediately after the current operation completes, before the event loop continues. It prioritizes the execution of the callback over I/O events and `setImmediate()` callbacks.

### 39. **What is the purpose of the `path` module in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths in Node.js. It is used to handle and transform file paths in a platform-independent way, avoiding issues related to different operating systems' path formats.

   Some commonly used methods include:
   - **`path.join()`:** Joins multiple path segments together.
   - **`path.resolve()`:** Resolves a sequence of paths into an absolute path.
   - **`path.basename()`:** Returns the last portion of a path.
   - **`path.dirname()`:** Returns the directory name of a path.

### 40. **What is the difference between `__dirname` and `process.cwd()`?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`__dirname`:** Returns the directory name of the current module file. It is relative to where the file is located.
   - **`process.cwd()`:** Returns the current working directory of the Node.js process, which can change if the process is executed in different directories or if the working directory is modified during runtime.

### 41. **Explain the concept of middleware order in Express.js.**
   **Answer:**  
   In Express.js, middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined. This order is critical because the middleware stack is processed sequentially, meaning that the order in which middleware is applied can affect the behavior of the application.

   For example, if you have an authentication middleware and a route handler, the authentication middleware should be placed before the route handler to ensure that the user is authenticated before accessing the route.

### 42. **What is `req.params`, `req.query`, and `req.body` in Express.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`req.params`:** Contains route parameters, which are variables defined in the route path (e.g., `/user/:id` would have `req.params.id`).
   - **`req.query`:** Contains query string parameters, which are key-value pairs appended to the URL (e.g., `/search?query=Node.js` would have `req.query.query`).
   - **`req.body`:** Contains the body of the request, usually used with POST or PUT requests to send data. It requires body-parsing middleware like `express.json()` or `express.urlencoded()` to be available.

### 43. **What is the role of `module.exports` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   `module.exports` is a special object in Node.js used to define what a module exports and makes available for other files to require. When another file uses `require()` to load the module, it receives the object or function defined in `module.exports`.

   ```javascript
   // In moduleA.js
   module.exports = function() {
     return 'Hello, World!';
   };
   
   // In another file
   const greet = require('./moduleA');
   console.log(greet()); // Outputs: Hello, World!
   ```

### 44. **What is an EventEmitter in Node.js, and how does it work?**
   **Answer:**  
   An `EventEmitter` is a class in Node.js that allows you to create and handle custom events. Instances of `EventEmitter` emit named events that cause listeners (functions) to be called. It’s a core part of Node.js’s event-driven architecture.

   ```javascript
   const EventEmitter = require('events');
   const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

   // Listener function
   myEmitter.on('event', () => {
     console.log('An event occurred!');
   });

   // Emitting the event
   myEmitter.emit('event');
   ```

### 45. **How do you prevent callback hell in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Callback hell, also known as the "pyramid of doom," occurs when multiple nested callbacks make code difficult to read and maintain. It can be avoided using:
   - **Promises:** Replace nested callbacks with `.then()` chaining.
   - **Async/Await:** Allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style.
   - **Modularization:** Break code into smaller, reusable functions.
   - **Error-first callbacks:** Consistently handle errors and success in a single callback function.

### 46. **What is the purpose of the `crypto` module in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `crypto` module provides cryptographic functionality in Node.js, including hashing, encryption, and decryption. It supports various cryptographic algorithms like AES, HMAC, RSA, etc., and is used for securing sensitive data, generating random values, and creating secure tokens.

   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');
   const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update('password').digest('hex');
   console.log(hash); // Outputs the SHA-256 hash of the string 'password'
   ```

### 47. **What is the difference between a process and a thread in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **Process:** An independent execution context with its own memory space. In Node.js, each instance of Node.js runs as a single process.
   - **Thread:** A smaller unit of a process that can be managed independently. Node.js traditionally runs on a single thread, but with the `worker_threads` module, it can create multiple threads within the same process to perform parallel tasks.

### 48. **How do you handle file streams in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   File streams in Node.js allow you to read and write files efficiently without loading the entire file into memory. You can create readable and writable streams using the `fs` module.

   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');

   // Reading a file stream
   const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
   readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
     console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
   });

   // Writing to a file stream
   const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
   writeStream.write('Hello, World!\n');
   ```

### 49. **Explain the concept of sticky sessions in Node.js.**
   **Answer:**  
   Sticky sessions refer to a load balancing strategy where requests from the same client are consistently directed to the same server (or process). This is important in applications where session data is stored in memory, ensuring that the client’s subsequent requests are handled by the same instance that has their session information.

### 50. **What are the different types of HTTP status codes, and what do they represent?**
   **Answer:**  
   HTTP status codes indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. Some common categories include:
   - **1xx (Informational):** Request received, continuing process.
   - **2xx (Success):** The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created).
   - **3xx (Redirection):** Further action needs to be taken to complete the request (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently, 304 Not Modified).
   - **4xx (Client Error):** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found).
   - **5xx (Server Error):** The server failed to fulfill a valid request (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable).

### 51. **What is a memory leak in Node.js, and how can you detect and prevent it?**
   **Answer:**  
   A memory leak occurs when a program fails to release memory that is no longer needed, leading to progressively increasing memory usage and potential application crashes. In Node.js, memory leaks can be detected using tools like `Node.js --inspect`, Chrome DevTools, or memory profiling tools like `clinic.js`.

   To prevent memory leaks:
   - **Avoid global variables:** Ensure variables are properly scoped.
   - **Manage event listeners:** Remove event listeners when they are no longer needed.
   - **Monitor and clean up resources:** Ensure that file handles, database connections, and other resources are properly closed.

### 52. **How does Node.js handle errors in asynchronous code?**
   **Answer:**  
   In asynchronous code, errors can be handled using:
   - **Callbacks:** Use the error-first callback pattern, where the first argument in the callback is an error object, allowing you to check for errors.
   - **Promises:** Use `.catch()` to handle errors in promises.
   - **Async/Await:** Use `try/catch` blocks around `await` statements to handle errors in asynchronous functions.

Certainly! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, continuing from number 53.

### 53. **What are JWTs, and how are they used in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in Node.js applications. JWTs consist of three parts: a header, payload, and signature.

   In Node.js, JWTs are often used to manage user sessions. After a user successfully logs in, a JWT is generated and sent to the client, which then includes it in the Authorization header of subsequent requests. On the server side, the JWT can be verified to authenticate the user.

   Example using `jsonwebtoken` package:
   ```javascript
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
   const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123 }, 'yourSecretKey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
   const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'yourSecretKey');
   console.log(decoded.userId); // 123
   ```

### 54. **What is the `cluster` module in Node.js, and how does it work?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `cluster` module allows you to create child processes (workers) that share the same server port, enabling you to take advantage of multi-core systems by distributing load across multiple CPUs. This is particularly useful for improving the performance of CPU-bound tasks in Node.js.

   Example of using the `cluster` module:
   ```javascript
   const cluster = require('cluster');
   const http = require('http');
   const os = require('os');

   if (cluster.isMaster) {
     const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;
     for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
       cluster.fork();
     }
     cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
       console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
     });
   } else {
     http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200);
       res.end('Hello, World!');
     }).listen(8000);
   }
   ```

### 55. **What are the differences between `readable.pipe()` and `stream.pipeline()` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`readable.pipe()`:** Pipes data from a readable stream to a writable stream. It is simple to use but doesn't provide built-in error handling or support for async functions.
   - **`stream.pipeline()`:** Introduced in Node.js v10, it provides a better way to compose streams with error handling. It ensures that errors are properly propagated and handles stream cleanup, making it more robust for production use.

   Example using `stream.pipeline()`:
   ```javascript
   const { pipeline } = require('stream');
   const fs = require('fs');
   const zlib = require('zlib');

   pipeline(
     fs.createReadStream('file.txt'),
     zlib.createGzip(),
     fs.createWriteStream('file.txt.gz'),
     (err) => {
       if (err) {
         console.error('Pipeline failed', err);
       } else {
         console.log('Pipeline succeeded');
       }
     }
   );
   ```

### 56. **How do you manage configuration settings in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   Configuration management in Node.js can be handled in several ways:
   - **Environment variables:** Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in environment variables, accessible through `process.env`.
   - **Configuration files:** Use JSON, YAML, or other configuration files to store settings, which can be loaded and parsed at runtime.
   - **Config management libraries:** Tools like `dotenv`, `config`, and `rc` can be used to manage configuration in different environments (development, production, etc.).

   Example using `dotenv`:
   ```javascript
   require('dotenv').config();
   console.log(process.env.DB_HOST);
   ```

### 57. **What is the role of the `http` module in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `http` module is a core module in Node.js used to create HTTP servers and handle HTTP requests and responses. It provides the functionality to build web servers, handle incoming requests, and send responses back to clients.

   Example of creating a simple HTTP server:
   ```javascript
   const http = require('http');

   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
     res.statusCode = 200;
     res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
     res.end('Hello, World!\n');
   });

   server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
     console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
   });
   ```

### 58. **What is a race condition in Node.js, and how can you prevent it?**
   **Answer:**  
   A race condition occurs when the outcome of an operation depends on the timing or sequence of events that could be unpredictable, leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior. In Node.js, race conditions can occur when multiple asynchronous operations interact with shared resources.

   To prevent race conditions:
   - **Use locks or semaphores:** Ensure that only one operation can access a resource at a time.
   - **Use atomic operations:** Implement atomic operations where possible, ensuring that operations are completed as a single, uninterruptible step.
   - **Avoid shared state:** Minimize shared state by using local variables or isolated instances.

### 59. **What is an LTS (Long-Term Support) release in Node.js, and why is it important?**
   **Answer:**  
   An LTS release in Node.js is a version that receives long-term support, including security updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements for an extended period, typically 30 months. LTS releases are intended for production environments, providing stability and security. They are important for organizations that require reliable and consistent platform behavior.

### 60. **How can you ensure the security of a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   To ensure the security of a Node.js application:
   - **Use HTTPS:** Encrypt data in transit by using HTTPS.
   - **Validate and sanitize inputs:** Protect against injection attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs.
   - **Use environment variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables, not in the codebase.
   - **Update dependencies:** Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
   - **Implement rate limiting:** Prevent brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.
   - **Use security headers:** Implement security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Frame-Options`.

### 61. **What is `npm` and what are some of its common commands?**
   **Answer:**  
   `npm` (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js, used to install, share, and manage packages (libraries) that you can use in your projects. Common `npm` commands include:
   - **`npm init`:** Initializes a new Node.js project and creates a `package.json` file.
   - **`npm install <package>`:** Installs a package and adds it to the `node_modules` directory.
   - **`npm uninstall <package>`:** Removes a package from your project.
   - **`npm update`:** Updates installed packages to their latest versions.
   - **`npm run <script>`:** Runs a script defined in the `package.json` file.
   - **`npm publish`:** Publishes a package to the npm registry.

### 62. **What is the `fs.promises` API in Node.js, and how does it differ from the callback-based `fs` module?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `fs.promises` API provides promise-based versions of the `fs` module's asynchronous methods, allowing you to use `async/await` for file system operations instead of callbacks.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs').promises;

   async function readFile() {
     try {
       const data = await fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8');
       console.log(data);
     } catch (err) {
       console.error('Error reading file', err);
     }
   }

   readFile();
   ```

   This approach results in cleaner and more readable code compared to callback-based methods.

### 63. **How do you handle pagination in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   Pagination is used to split large datasets into smaller chunks or pages. In Node.js, pagination can be implemented by using query parameters to specify the page number and page size, then fetching only the relevant data from the database.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/items', async (req, res) => {
     const page = parseInt(req.query.page) || 1;
     const limit = parseInt(req.query.limit) || 10;
     const skip = (page - 1) * limit;

     const items = await Item.find().skip(skip).limit(limit);
     res.json(items);
   });
   ```

Certainly! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, continuing from number 64.

### 64. **What is a RESTful API, and how do you implement one in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on resources, typically represented by URIs.

   Example of implementing a simple RESTful API in Node.js using Express.js:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());

   const items = [
     { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
     { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
   ];

   app.get('/items', (req, res) => {
     res.json(items);
   });

   app.post('/items', (req, res) => {
     const newItem = { id: items.length + 1, name: req.body.name };
     items.push(newItem);
     res.status(201).json(newItem);
   });

   app.put('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
     const item = items.find(i => i.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
     if (!item) return res.status(404).send('Item not found');
     item.name = req.body.name;
     res.json(item);
   });

   app.delete('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
     const itemIndex = items.findIndex(i => i.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
     if (itemIndex === -1) return res.status(404).send('Item not found');
     const deletedItem = items.splice(itemIndex, 1);
     res.json(deletedItem);
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

### 65. **What are streams in Node.js, and what are their types?**
   **Answer:**  
   Streams in Node.js are objects that allow you to read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous manner. They are used to handle large amounts of data, such as reading files or making HTTP requests, without loading the entire data into memory at once.

   Types of streams:
   - **Readable streams:** Allow reading data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream()`).
   - **Writable streams:** Allow writing data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream()`).
   - **Duplex streams:** Allow both reading and writing (e.g., TCP sockets).
   - **Transform streams:** Allow modifying or transforming the data as it is read or written (e.g., `zlib.createGzip()`).

   Example of a readable stream:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });

   readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
     console.log('Received chunk:', chunk);
   });

   readableStream.on('end', () => {
     console.log('No more data.');
   });
   ```

### 66. **What is middleware in Express.js, and how does it work?**
   **Answer:**  
   Middleware in Express.js refers to functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and more.

   Middleware can be:
   - **Application-level:** Applied to the entire application using `app.use()`.
   - **Router-level:** Applied to specific routes using `router.use()`.
   - **Built-in:** Provided by Express.js, like `express.json()`.
   - **Third-party:** Available through npm, like `morgan` for logging.

   Example of middleware usage:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Application-level middleware
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
     next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
   });

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

### 67. **What is the Event Loop in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   The Event Loop is the heart of Node.js’s asynchronous, non-blocking architecture. It is responsible for handling all asynchronous operations by processing the event queue, executing callback functions, and continuing to process incoming I/O operations.

   The Event Loop works in phases:
   - **Timers:** Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.
   - **Pending Callbacks:** Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.
   - **Idle, Prepare:** Internal operations for the event loop.
   - **Poll:** Retrieves new I/O events and executes their callbacks.
   - **Check:** Executes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate()`.
   - **Close Callbacks:** Handles `close` events for resources like sockets.

   This loop continues indefinitely, ensuring that the Node.js application remains responsive.

### 68. **What is CORS, and how do you enable it in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. It’s a way to control which resources can be accessed across different origins.

   To enable CORS in a Node.js application using Express.js, you can use the `cors` middleware:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const cors = require('cors');
   const app = express();

   app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for all routes

   app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
     res.json({ message: 'This is CORS-enabled!' });
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   You can also configure CORS for specific domains, methods, or headers.

### 69. **What are the differences between `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, and `process.nextTick` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`setTimeout(callback, delay)`:** Schedules the `callback` function to be executed after a minimum of `delay` milliseconds. The actual delay can be longer due to the event loop's scheduling.

   - **`setImmediate(callback)`:** Schedules the `callback` to execute immediately after the I/O events in the current event loop cycle. It’s similar to `setTimeout` with a `0` delay but executes after I/O events.

   - **`process.nextTick(callback)`:** Schedules the `callback` to be invoked on the same phase of the event loop, before the next I/O event. It has higher priority over `setImmediate`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => console.log('setTimeout'), 0);
   setImmediate(() => console.log('setImmediate'));
   process.nextTick(() => console.log('process.nextTick'));
   // Output: process.nextTick -> setImmediate -> setTimeout
   ```

### 70. **How do you perform file uploads in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   File uploads in Node.js can be handled using middleware like `multer`. `multer` processes `multipart/form-data` and stores uploaded files on the server.

   Example of handling a file upload using Express.js and `multer`:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const multer = require('multer');
   const app = express();

   const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' }); // Define the storage destination

   app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
     console.log(req.file); // The uploaded file's information
     res.send('File uploaded successfully!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   In this example, files are stored in the `uploads/` directory, and `req.file` contains metadata about the uploaded file.

### 71. **What are worker threads in Node.js, and when should you use them?**
   **Answer:**  
   Worker threads in Node.js allow you to run JavaScript code in parallel in multiple threads. This is useful for performing CPU-intensive tasks that would otherwise block the main event loop.

   The `worker_threads` module provides an interface to create and manage worker threads:
   ```javascript
   const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

   if (isMainThread) {
     const worker = new Worker(__filename);
     worker.on('message', (message) => console.log('Received from worker:', message));
   } else {
     parentPort.postMessage('Hello from worker');
   }
   ```

   Worker threads are ideal for tasks like processing large datasets, performing complex calculations, or handling CPU-bound tasks that would otherwise slow down the responsiveness of the Node.js application.

Certainly! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, continuing from number 72.

### 72. **How do you implement session management in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   Session management in a Node.js application can be handled using the `express-session` middleware. Sessions are used to persist user data across different requests. The session data is stored on the server, and a session ID is stored in a cookie on the client.

   Example of implementing session management:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const session = require('express-session');
   const app = express();

   app.use(session({
     secret: 'your-secret-key',
     resave: false,
     saveUninitialized: true,
     cookie: { secure: false } // Set secure to true if using HTTPS
   }));

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     if (!req.session.views) {
       req.session.views = 1;
     } else {
       req.session.views++;
     }
     res.send(`Number of views: ${req.session.views}`);
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   In this example, each time the user visits the root route (`/`), the number of views is incremented and stored in the session.

### 73. **What are microservices, and how can you implement them in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Microservices is an architectural style where a large application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service focuses on a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

   In Node.js, microservices can be implemented using frameworks like `Express.js` for creating individual services, and tools like `Docker` and `Kubernetes` for deploying and managing them.

   Example structure of a microservice:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.get('/service', (req, res) => {
     res.send('This is a microservice!');
   });

   app.listen(3001, () => console.log('Microservice running on port 3001'));
   ```

   In a microservices architecture, each service has its own database, logic, and API, and they communicate with each other using REST, gRPC, or messaging queues like RabbitMQ.

### 74. **What is `npm audit`, and how do you use it?**
   **Answer:**  
   `npm audit` is a command that helps you identify and fix vulnerabilities in the dependencies of your Node.js project. It scans the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file for known security issues and reports them.

   To use `npm audit`:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

   This command will display a report of vulnerabilities. You can fix issues automatically by running:
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   ```

   For critical vulnerabilities that require manual intervention, `npm audit fix --force` might be necessary, but it may update packages to breaking versions.

### 75. **What is `helmet`, and how does it enhance security in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   `helmet` is a middleware for Express.js that helps secure your Node.js applications by setting various HTTP headers. It provides protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, content sniffing, and clickjacking.

   Example of using `helmet`:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const helmet = require('helmet');
   const app = express();

   app.use(helmet());

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   By default, `helmet` applies a set of security headers, such as `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-Frame-Options`, which help mitigate common security threats.

### 76. **How do you handle error logging in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   Error logging is essential for monitoring and debugging a Node.js application. Common practices include:
   - **Using a logging library:** Libraries like `winston` or `morgan` can be used to log errors to files, databases, or external logging services.
   - **Logging unhandled exceptions:** Using `process.on('uncaughtException')` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')` to capture and log exceptions that were not handled.

   Example of using `winston` for error logging:
   ```javascript
   const winston = require('winston');
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   const logger = winston.createLogger({
     level: 'error',
     transports: [
       new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log' })
     ]
   });

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
   });

   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
     logger.error(err.message);
     res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

### 77. **What is the role of `package.json` in a Node.js project?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `package.json` file is a critical component of a Node.js project, serving multiple purposes:
   - **Dependency management:** Lists the project's dependencies and their versions.
   - **Metadata:** Contains metadata about the project, like name, version, description, author, and license.
   - **Scripts:** Defines custom scripts that can be run using `npm run`, such as `npm run start` or `npm run test`.
   - **Configuration:** Provides configurations for tools and libraries, such as Babel, ESLint, and others.

   Example of a `package.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-node-app",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "A simple Node.js app",
     "main": "index.js",
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node index.js",
       "test": "mocha"
     },
     "dependencies": {
       "express": "^4.17.1"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "mocha": "^8.2.1"
     },
     "author": "Akhilesh Kumar Ojha",
     "license": "MIT"
   }
   ```

### 78. **What is a proxy in Node.js, and how do you implement one?**
   **Answer:**  
   A proxy in Node.js acts as an intermediary between a client and another server. It forwards client requests to the target server and then relays the responses back to the client. Proxies can be used for load balancing, caching, or adding security layers.

   Example of a simple proxy server using `http-proxy`:
   ```javascript
   const http = require('http');
   const httpProxy = require('http-proxy');
   const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({});

   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
     proxy.web(req, res, { target: 'http://example.com' });
   });

   server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Proxy server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   In this example, the proxy server listens on port 3000 and forwards all incoming requests to `http://example.com`.

### 79. **What is `Socket.IO`, and how do you use it in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   `Socket.IO` is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. It is built on top of WebSockets but provides additional fallbacks for environments where WebSockets are not supported.

   Example of a basic `Socket.IO` server:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const http = require('http');
   const socketIo = require('socket.io');
   const app = express();
   const server = http.createServer(app);
   const io = socketIo(server);

   io.on('connection', (socket) => {
     console.log('A user connected');
     socket.on('message', (msg) => {
       console.log('Message received:', msg);
       io.emit('message', msg);
     });
     socket.on('disconnect', () => {
       console.log('A user disconnected');
     });
   });

   server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   In this example, the server listens for connections and allows clients to send and receive messages in real-time.

Sure! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, continuing from number 80.

### 80. **What are the benefits of using TypeScript with Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Using TypeScript with Node.js offers several benefits:
   - **Static Typing:** TypeScript introduces static types to JavaScript, which helps catch type-related errors during development and improves code reliability.
   - **Enhanced IDE Support:** TypeScript provides improved IntelliSense, autocompletion, and refactoring capabilities in editors like VS Code.
   - **Better Documentation:** The use of interfaces and type annotations in TypeScript makes the code more self-documenting, aiding in collaboration and maintainability.
   - **Advanced Language Features:** TypeScript includes features like interfaces, generics, and enums, which are not available in plain JavaScript, allowing for more expressive and organized code.

   Example using TypeScript in a Node.js application:
   ```typescript
   import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';

   const app = express();

   app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
     res.send('Hello, TypeScript with Node.js!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

### 81. **What is clustering in Node.js, and how does it work?**
   **Answer:**  
   Clustering in Node.js is a technique used to take advantage of multi-core systems. By default, Node.js runs on a single thread, but with clustering, you can create multiple instances (workers) of your application to handle requests in parallel.

   The `cluster` module allows you to create child processes (workers) that share the same server port. Each worker runs in its own Node.js instance.

   Example of a simple clustering setup:
   ```javascript
   const cluster = require('cluster');
   const http = require('http');
   const os = require('os');

   if (cluster.isMaster) {
     const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;
     console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

     // Fork workers
     for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
       cluster.fork();
     }

     cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
       console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
     });
   } else {
     // Workers can share any TCP connection
     http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200);
       res.end('Hello, Cluster!');
     }).listen(8000);

     console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
   }
   ```

   Clustering improves the performance of CPU-bound tasks by utilizing all available CPU cores.

### 82. **What is the purpose of the `package-lock.json` file?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated when you run `npm install` and contains the exact versions of all installed dependencies, including nested dependencies. It ensures that subsequent installations produce the same dependency tree, making the build process more reliable and consistent across different environments.

   Key purposes of `package-lock.json`:
   - **Version Consistency:** Ensures that all developers on a project have the same versions of dependencies.
   - **Faster Installations:** Speeds up the `npm install` process by reducing the need to resolve package versions.
   - **Security:** Helps in auditing dependencies by locking down specific versions known to be secure.

### 83. **What are child processes in Node.js, and how do you create one?**
   **Answer:**  
   Child processes in Node.js allow you to run external processes or execute other scripts concurrently. The `child_process` module provides methods to spawn, fork, or execute child processes.

   There are four main ways to create child processes:
   - **`spawn`:** Launches a new process with a given command.
   - **`exec`:** Executes a command in a shell and buffers the output.
   - **`execFile`:** Similar to `exec`, but directly executes a binary or script without a shell.
   - **`fork`:** A special case of `spawn` that creates a new Node.js process and establishes communication with the parent process.

   Example using `spawn`:
   ```javascript
   const { spawn } = require('child_process');

   const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);

   ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
     console.log(`Output: ${data}`);
   });

   ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
     console.error(`Error: ${data}`);
   });

   ls.on('close', (code) => {
     console.log(`Child process exited with code ${code}`);
   });
   ```

### 84. **What is the difference between `spawn` and `exec` in the `child_process` module?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`spawn`:** Launches a new process with a specified command and arguments. It returns a stream (stdout, stderr) and is more suitable for handling large amounts of data because it doesn't buffer the output in memory.
     ```javascript
     const { spawn } = require('child_process');
     const child = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
     ```

   - **`exec`:** Executes a command in a shell and buffers the output in memory, returning it in a callback function. It is more straightforward to use when you need the entire output at once.
     ```javascript
     const { exec } = require('child_process');
     exec('ls -lh /usr', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
       if (error) {
         console.error(`Exec error: ${error}`);
         return;
       }
       console.log(`Output: ${stdout}`);
     });
     ```

   **Key Differences:**
   - **Memory Usage:** `spawn` streams data and is more efficient for large outputs, while `exec` buffers the entire output in memory.
   - **Shell:** `exec` runs commands in a shell, making it more versatile but slightly less efficient than `spawn`.

### 85. **How do you handle file uploads in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   File uploads in a Node.js application are commonly handled using middleware like `multer`. `multer` processes `multipart/form-data` and stores uploaded files on the server.

   Example of handling file uploads with `multer`:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const multer = require('multer');
   const app = express();

   const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' }); // Destination folder

   app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
     console.log(req.file); // Metadata about the uploaded file
     res.send('File uploaded successfully!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   In this example, files are stored in the `uploads/` directory, and metadata about the uploaded file is accessible through `req.file`.

### 86. **What are the differences between `npm` and `yarn`?**
   **Answer:**  
   Both `npm` (Node Package Manager) and `yarn` are package managers for JavaScript that help manage project dependencies. However, they have some differences:

   - **Performance:** Yarn was initially faster than npm due to parallelized installation, but npm has caught up with improvements in npm 5 and beyond.
   - **Lock Files:** Yarn uses `yarn.lock`, while npm uses `package-lock.json` to lock dependencies' versions. Both ensure consistent installs across environments.
   - **Offline Mode:** Yarn allows installing dependencies even when offline if they were previously installed.
   - **Deterministic Installs:** Yarn guarantees that an install will be exactly the same across all systems if the lock file remains unchanged.
   - **Command Differences:** Although most commands are similar, there are differences in how some tasks are executed, like `yarn add` vs. `npm install`.

### 87. **How do you use the `crypto` module in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `crypto` module in Node.js provides cryptographic functionality, including a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify functions.

   Example of creating a hash using the `crypto` module:
   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');

   const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
   hash.update('Some data to hash');
   console.log(hash.digest('hex'));
   ```

   Example of encrypting and decrypting data:
   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');
   const algorithm = 'aes-256-cbc';
   const key = crypto.randomBytes(32);
   const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

   // Encrypt
   const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);
   let encrypted = cipher.update('Some data to encrypt', 'utf8', 'hex');
   encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
   console.log('Encrypted:', encrypted);

   // Decrypt
   const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);
   let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
   decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
   console.log('Decrypted:', decrypted);
   ```

   The `crypto` module is essential for implementing secure data encryption, hashing, and signature validation in Node.js applications.

### 88. **What are the differences between `path.join()` and `path.resolve()` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Both `path.join()` and `path.resolve()` are methods in the Node.js `path` module used to handle and manipulate file paths, but they serve different purposes:

   - **`path.join()`**: Joins all given path segments together using the platform-specific separator (`/` on Unix-like systems, `\` on Windows). It doesn't normalize or resolve the path to an absolute path.
     ```javascript
     const path = require('path');
     console.log(path.join('folder', 'subfolder', 'file.txt'));
     // Outputs: 'folder/subfolder/file.txt'
     ```

   - **`path.resolve()`**: Resolves a sequence of paths into an absolute path. If no path segments start with `/`, it assumes the current working directory as the starting point. It can also handle `..` and `.` segments in paths.
     ```javascript
     const path = require('path');
     console.log(path.resolve('folder', 'subfolder', 'file.txt'));
     // Outputs: '/current/working/directory/folder/subfolder/file.txt'
     ```

   **Key Differences**:
   - **Absolute vs. Relative**: `path.resolve()` returns an absolute path, whereas `path.join()` returns a relative path.
   - **Normalization**: `path.resolve()` normalizes the path by resolving `..` and `.` segments, while `path.join()` does not.

### 89. **What is the `async_hooks` module in Node.js, and how is it used?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `async_hooks` module in Node.js provides an API to track asynchronous resources in a Node.js application. It allows developers to monitor the lifecycle of asynchronous operations, such as Promises, network requests, and file system operations.

   Example of using `async_hooks`:
   ```javascript
   const asyncHooks = require('async_hooks');
   const fs = require('fs');

   const hooks = {
     init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) {
       fs.writeSync(1, `Init: ${asyncId} - Type: ${type}\n`);
     },
     before(asyncId) {
       fs.writeSync(1, `Before: ${asyncId}\n`);
     },
     after(asyncId) {
       fs.writeSync(1, `After: ${asyncId}\n`);
     },
     destroy(asyncId) {
       fs.writeSync(1, `Destroy: ${asyncId}\n`);
     }
   };

   const asyncHook = asyncHooks.createHook(hooks);
   asyncHook.enable();

   setTimeout(() => {
     console.log('Timeout executed');
   }, 100);
   ```

   **Use Cases**:
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Track the execution time of asynchronous operations.
   - **Debugging**: Understand the flow of asynchronous operations and identify potential memory leaks.
   - **Custom Context Propagation**: Pass contextual data across asynchronous boundaries.

### 90. **What are `Streams` in Node.js, and what are their types?**
   **Answer:**  
   Streams in Node.js are objects that enable the reading or writing of data in a continuous flow, rather than loading the entire data into memory at once. Streams are particularly useful for handling large data sets, such as reading files, handling HTTP requests, or processing large datasets.

   **Types of Streams**:
   - **Readable Streams**: Used to read data from a source. Example: `fs.createReadStream()`.
   - **Writable Streams**: Used to write data to a destination. Example: `fs.createWriteStream()`.
   - **Duplex Streams**: Both readable and writable. Example: TCP sockets.
   - **Transform Streams**: Duplex streams that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read. Example: `zlib.createGzip()` for compressing data.

   Example of using a readable stream:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt');

   readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
     console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
   });

   readableStream.on('end', () => {
     console.log('No more data to read.');
   });
   ```

### 91. **What is middleware in Express.js, and how does it work?**
   **Answer:**  
   Middleware in Express.js is a function that executes during the lifecycle of an HTTP request. Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects and the `next` function, which is used to pass control to the next middleware function.

   **Types of Middleware**:
   - **Application-level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of `express` using `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()`.
   - **Router-level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of `express.Router()`.
   - **Error-handling Middleware**: Takes four arguments (`err, req, res, next`) and handles errors that occur in the application.
   - **Built-in Middleware**: Express has some built-in middleware like `express.json()` and `express.static()`.

   Example of middleware in Express.js:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Application-level middleware
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
     next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
   });

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, Middleware!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   In this example, the middleware logs the request URL before the request is handled by the route.

### 92. **How does `eventEmitter` work in Node.js, and what are its use cases?**
   **Answer:**  
   `eventEmitter` is a class in Node.js that facilitates the creation, management, and handling of events within an application. It is part of the `events` module, which allows an object to emit named events that cause functions (listeners) to be executed when those events are emitted.

   Example of using `eventEmitter`:
   ```javascript
   const EventEmitter = require('events');
   const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

   // Define an event listener
   eventEmitter.on('greet', () => {
     console.log('Hello, World!');
   });

   // Emit the event
   eventEmitter.emit('greet');
   ```

   **Use Cases**:
   - **Custom Event Handling**: Create custom events for decoupling components or modules.
   - **Asynchronous Operations**: Handle the completion of asynchronous operations, such as reading a file or making an HTTP request.
   - **Real-time Applications**: Emit events in real-time applications like chat systems or live notifications.

### 93. **What is the purpose of `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   `process.nextTick()` is a function that schedules a callback function to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, before any I/O events (such as timers or network events) are handled. It allows developers to execute code asynchronously but with higher priority than other tasks in the event loop.

   Example usage:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Before nextTick');

   process.nextTick(() => {
     console.log('Inside nextTick');
   });

   console.log('After nextTick');
   ```

   **Output**:
   ```
   Before nextTick
   After nextTick
   Inside nextTick
   ```

   **Use Cases**:
   - **Avoid Blocking Operations**: Break up long-running operations into smaller chunks to prevent blocking the event loop.
   - **Asynchronous Initialization**: Ensure certain code runs after the current operation completes but before the event loop continues.

### 94. **How do you implement pagination in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   Pagination is used to divide large datasets into smaller chunks or pages, allowing users to navigate through data more easily. In Node.js, pagination can be implemented by limiting the number of records returned by a database query and providing options to skip a specific number of records.

   Example of pagination with MongoDB:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
   const app = express();
   const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
   const dbName = 'mydatabase';

   MongoClient.connect(url, { useUnifiedTopology: true }, (err, client) => {
     if (err) throw err;
     const db = client.db(dbName);
     const collection = db.collection('documents');

     app.get('/data', async (req, res) => {
       const page = parseInt(req.query.page) || 1;
       const limit = parseInt(req.query.limit) || 10;
       const skip = (page - 1) * limit;

       const data = await collection.find().skip(skip).limit(limit).toArray();
       res.json(data);
     });

     app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   });
   ```

   **Key Concepts**:
   - **Page**: The current page number.
   - **Limit**: The number of records to display per page.
   - **Skip**: The number of records to skip before selecting records for the current page.

Certainly! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, starting from number 95.

### 95. **What are `Generators` in Node.js, and how do they differ from `Promises`?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Generators** in Node.js are a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, allowing for the creation of asynchronous code that is more readable and manageable. Generators are defined using the `function*` syntax and yield values using the `yield` keyword.

   **Example of a Generator function:**
   ```javascript
   function* generatorFunction() {
     yield 'First value';
     yield 'Second value';
     return 'Final value';
   }

   const gen = generatorFunction();
   console.log(gen.next().value); // Output: 'First value'
   console.log(gen.next().value); // Output: 'Second value'
   console.log(gen.next().value); // Output: 'Final value'
   ```

   **Differences between Generators and Promises:**
   - **Control Flow**:
     - **Generators**: Provide a manual control flow by allowing the function to pause and resume at specific points.
     - **Promises**: Represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and are used with `.then()` and `catch()` to handle asynchronous flows.
   
   - **Asynchronous Handling**:
     - **Generators**: Can be used to handle asynchronous operations by yielding Promises, often used in combination with libraries like `co` or `async` functions.
     - **Promises**: Handle asynchronous operations more directly and are chainable, making them more suitable for complex asynchronous flows.

   - **Syntax**:
     - **Generators**: Use `function*` and `yield`.
     - **Promises**: Use `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `async/await`.

   **Combining Generators with Promises:**
   ```javascript
   const fetchData = () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('Data fetched'), 1000));

   function* generator() {
     const data = yield fetchData();
     console.log(data);
   }

   const gen = generator();
   const promise = gen.next().value;
   promise.then((result) => gen.next(result));
   ```

### 96. **How do you implement rate limiting in a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   Rate limiting is used to control the number of requests a user can make to a server within a specified time frame. It helps protect the server from being overwhelmed by too many requests, often used in APIs.

   **Implementation Example with Express and `express-rate-limit` middleware:**
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   const app = express();

   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   });

   app.use(limiter);

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Rate limiting in action!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   **Key Concepts:**
   - **windowMs**: Time frame for which requests are checked/remembered.
   - **max**: Maximum number of requests allowed within the `windowMs` timeframe.
   - **Headers**: The middleware automatically sends `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers to indicate the rate limit status to the client.

   **Use Cases**:
   - **API Protection**: Preventing abuse by limiting the number of requests per user or IP.
   - **Resource Management**: Ensuring that server resources are not exhausted by too many requests.

### 97. **What are `Worker Threads` in Node.js, and when should you use them?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Worker Threads** in Node.js allow you to run JavaScript code in parallel using multiple threads. This is particularly useful for CPU-intensive tasks that would otherwise block the main event loop, such as image processing, heavy calculations, or data compression.

   **Example of using Worker Threads:**
   ```javascript
   const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

   if (isMainThread) {
     const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
       workerData: { num: 5 },
     });

     worker.on('message', (result) => {
       console.log(`Result from worker: ${result}`);
     });
   } else {
     const result = workerData.num * 2;
     parentPort.postMessage(result);
   }
   ```

   **When to Use Worker Threads:**
   - **CPU-Intensive Tasks**: When you need to perform operations that are computationally expensive and would otherwise block the main thread.
   - **Parallel Processing**: When you need to execute multiple tasks in parallel, leveraging multiple CPU cores.

   **Advantages**:
   - **Non-Blocking**: Offloads heavy tasks to a separate thread, keeping the main thread responsive.
   - **Scalability**: Enables better utilization of multi-core processors.

### 98. **What is the purpose of `libuv` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   **`libuv`** is a multi-platform C library that provides Node.js with asynchronous I/O operations. It is responsible for handling the event loop, non-blocking I/O, and other core functionalities like file system operations, DNS resolution, and network communication.

   **Key Responsibilities of `libuv`:**
   - **Event Loop**: Manages the event loop, scheduling and executing callbacks.
   - **Thread Pool**: Handles operations that can't be performed asynchronously, such as file system operations, by offloading them to a thread pool.
   - **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Abstracts differences between operating systems, allowing Node.js to run consistently across platforms.

   **Importance in Node.js**:
   - **Non-Blocking I/O**: Enables Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently by using non-blocking I/O operations.
   - **Performance**: Improves performance by efficiently managing asynchronous operations.

### 99. **What are `named exports` and `default exports` in Node.js, and how do they differ?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Named Exports** and **Default Exports** are concepts primarily associated with ES6 modules in Node.js, though they can also be used in client-side JavaScript.

   - **Named Exports**: Allow you to export multiple values from a module, each with its own name. You can export functions, objects, or primitives.
     ```javascript
     // math.js
     export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
     export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

     // In another file
     import { add, subtract } from './math.js';
     ```

   - **Default Exports**: Allow you to export a single value from a module, which can be imported without specifying the exact name.
     ```javascript
     // math.js
     const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
     export default multiply;

     // In another file
     import multiply from './math.js';
     ```

   **Key Differences**:
   - **Flexibility**: Named exports allow for multiple exports from a single module, whereas default exports are limited to one per module.
   - **Import Syntax**: Named exports require curly braces `{}` during import, while default exports do not.

   **Usage Consideration**:
   - **Named Exports**: Use when a module needs to export multiple utilities or functions.
   - **Default Exports**: Use when a module has a single primary function or object to export.

### 100. **How do you debug a Node.js application?**
   **Answer:**  
   Debugging a Node.js application can be done using various tools and techniques. Here are some common methods:

   **1. Using the Built-in Debugger:**
   - You can start the Node.js debugger by running:
     ```bash
     node inspect app.js
     ```
   - You can then set breakpoints and step through the code using the debugger's commands.

   **2. Using `console.log`:**
   - The simplest and most common method is adding `console.log()` statements to output variable values and program flow.

   **3. Using Chrome DevTools:**
   - You can debug Node.js applications using Chrome DevTools by running:
     ```bash
     node --inspect app.js
     ```
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect` to connect to your Node.js process.

   **4. Using IDEs:**
   - Modern IDEs like Visual Studio Code offer built-in debugging tools. You can set breakpoints, watch variables, and step through code directly in the editor.

   **5. Using `node --inspect-brk`:**
   - This command starts your Node.js application in debug mode and pauses execution before the first line of code, allowing you to set breakpoints immediately.

   **Example using Visual Studio Code:**
   - Set up a `launch.json` configuration file in your project to configure the debugger.
   - Use the Debug panel in VS Code to start debugging with breakpoints.

   **Best Practices:**
   - **Use Breakpoints**: Instead of flooding your code with `console.log()`, use breakpoints for a cleaner debugging process.
   - **Check Stack Traces**: When errors occur, carefully inspect the stack trace to pinpoint the source of the issue.

Certainly! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, starting from number 100.

### 101. **What is a memory leak in Node.js, and how can you identify and prevent it?**
   **Answer:**  
   A **memory leak** in Node.js occurs when memory that is no longer needed is not released, leading to progressively higher memory usage, which can eventually crash the application.

   **Identifying Memory Leaks:**
   - **Heap Snapshots**: Use Chrome DevTools to take heap snapshots and compare them over time.
   - **Monitoring with `process.memoryUsage()`**: Track the memory usage of your application using this built-in method.
     ```javascript
     console.log(process.memoryUsage());
     ```
   - **Node.js Profiler**: Use the built-in V8 profiler to identify functions that consume excessive memory.
   - **Third-party Tools**: Tools like `heapdump` and `memwatch-next` can help track memory usage and detect leaks.

   **Common Causes of Memory Leaks:**
   - **Global Variables**: Unintentionally retaining references in global scope.
   - **Event Listeners**: Adding event listeners without removing them can lead to memory leaks.
   - **Closures**: Closures can hold onto variables longer than necessary if not properly managed.
   - **Uncleared Timers**: Set intervals or timeouts that are not cleared can cause memory issues.

   **Preventing Memory Leaks:**
   - **Avoid Global Variables**: Limit the use of global variables to prevent unintended memory retention.
   - **Remove Event Listeners**: Ensure event listeners are removed when they are no longer needed.
   - **Clear Timers**: Always clear intervals and timeouts when they are no longer required.
   - **Regular Profiling**: Regularly profile your application in a production-like environment to catch issues early.

### 102. **What is the difference between `cluster` and `worker_threads` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Both `cluster` and `worker_threads` modules in Node.js are used for handling concurrency and parallelism, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.

   **`Cluster` Module:**
   - **Purpose**: Allows you to create multiple processes (workers) that share the same server port, making it easier to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
   - **Process-based**: Each worker in a cluster is a separate Node.js process with its own memory and V8 instance.
   - **Use Case**: Primarily used for scaling applications across multiple CPU cores to handle more requests.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const cluster = require('cluster');
   const http = require('http');
   const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

   if (cluster.isMaster) {
     for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
       cluster.fork();
     }

     cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
       console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
     });
   } else {
     http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200);
       res.end('Hello, world!');
     }).listen(8000);
   }
   ```

   **`worker_threads` Module:**
   - **Purpose**: Enables the creation of multiple threads within a single Node.js process, each running in parallel.
   - **Thread-based**: All threads share the same memory space, which makes communication between them faster and more efficient.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for CPU-bound tasks that require parallel processing without creating separate processes.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

   if (isMainThread) {
     const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
       workerData: { num: 5 },
     });

     worker.on('message', (result) => {
       console.log(`Result from worker: ${result}`);
     });
   } else {
     const result = workerData.num * 2;
     parentPort.postMessage(result);
   }
   ```

   **Key Differences:**
   - **Memory Isolation**: Clusters are completely isolated, whereas worker threads share memory.
   - **Communication**: Inter-process communication (IPC) is required for clusters, while worker threads can communicate more directly through shared memory.
   - **Use Case**: Use clusters for scaling web servers and worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks within a single process.

### 103. **What is `Middleware` in Koa.js, and how does it differ from Express.js middleware?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Koa.js** is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, developed by the same team behind Express.js. Middleware in Koa.js is a fundamental concept, but it differs from Express.js in its implementation.

   **Koa.js Middleware:**
   - **Generator Functions/Async Functions**: Koa uses async functions (formerly generators) to handle middleware, allowing for a more elegant control flow.
   - **Compositional Middleware**: Koa’s middleware stack is composed using `await next()`, where each middleware can choose to pass control to the next middleware or handle the request itself.
   - **No `req` and `res`**: Koa does not have `req` and `res` objects. Instead, it uses a single `ctx` (context) object that encapsulates request and response information.

   **Example of Koa Middleware:**
   ```javascript
   const Koa = require('koa');
   const app = new Koa();

   app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
     console.log('First middleware');
     await next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
     console.log('First middleware after next');
   });

   app.use(async (ctx) => {
     ctx.body = 'Hello, Koa.js!';
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```

   **Differences from Express.js Middleware:**
   - **Control Flow**: In Koa, middleware functions are async and use `await next()` to yield control to the next middleware. In Express, middleware functions use `next()` to pass control.
   - **Context Object**: Koa uses a unified `ctx` object instead of separate `req` and `res` objects in Express.
   - **Error Handling**: Koa has a built-in mechanism for error handling using try/catch blocks in async middleware, making it easier to manage errors.

   **Advantages of Koa Middleware**:
   - **Cleaner Code**: The use of async/await in Koa middleware leads to cleaner, more readable code.
   - **Fine-grained Control**: Koa’s middleware architecture provides more control over the request-response cycle.

### 104. **What is `npm audit`, and how do you use it to ensure the security of your Node.js applications?**
   **Answer:**  
   **`npm audit`** is a command in the Node.js package manager (npm) that checks your project’s dependencies for known security vulnerabilities. It analyzes the dependency tree and compares it against the npm security advisories database.

   **Using `npm audit`:**
   - To run an audit, execute the following command in your project’s root directory:
     ```bash
     npm audit
     ```
   - The command outputs a report detailing vulnerabilities, including severity (low, moderate, high, critical), paths, and advisory links.

   **Example Output:**
   ```
   found 5 vulnerabilities (2 low, 1 moderate, 2 high) in 1000 scanned packages
     2 vulnerabilities require manual review. See the full report for details.
   ```

   **Automating Fixes with `npm audit fix`:**
   - You can attempt to automatically fix vulnerabilities by running:
     ```bash
     npm audit fix
     ```
   - This command updates dependencies to secure versions if possible.

   **Best Practices:**
   - **Regular Audits**: Integrate `npm audit` into your CI/CD pipeline to regularly scan for vulnerabilities.
   - **Manual Review**: For vulnerabilities that require manual review, carefully assess the impact and determine if you need to update or replace the affected packages.
   - **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and remove unused packages to minimize the attack surface.

### 105. **What is `EventEmitter` in Node.js, and how can it be used in an application?**
   **Answer:**  
   **`EventEmitter`** is a core module in Node.js that allows you to create and manage custom events. It is the foundation of the event-driven architecture in Node.js, where certain objects (like streams, HTTP requests, etc.) emit events that other objects (event listeners) can respond to.

   **Basic Usage of `EventEmitter`:**
   ```javascript
   const EventEmitter = require('events');
   const emitter = new EventEmitter();

   // Define an event listener
   emitter.on('greet', (name) => {
     console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   });

   // Emit the event
   emitter.emit('greet', 'John');
   ```

   **Use Cases:**
   - **Custom Events**: Emit custom events within your application for various tasks like logging, notifications, or state changes.
   - **Asynchronous Operations**: Emit events when asynchronous operations (e.g., file reading, API requests) complete, allowing other parts of the application to respond.
   - **Decoupling Components**: Use events to decouple components, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.

Certainly! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, starting from number 106.

### 106. **What is `process.nextTick()` in Node.js, and how does it differ from `setImmediate()`?**
   **Answer:**  
   **`process.nextTick()`** is a method in Node.js that allows you to schedule a callback function to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, before any I/O operations are processed.

   **`setImmediate()`** schedules a callback function to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop, after any I/O operations are processed.

   **Key Differences:**
   - **Timing**: `process.nextTick()` queues the callback to be executed immediately after the current operation completes, before any I/O events are handled. `setImmediate()` schedules the callback to run after I/O events in the next event loop iteration.
   - **Use Cases**: `process.nextTick()` is used for deferring the execution of a function until the current stack is cleared, ensuring the callback runs before any other I/O or timer events. `setImmediate()` is useful when you want to allow I/O operations to be processed before executing the callback.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Start');

   process.nextTick(() => {
     console.log('Next Tick');
   });

   setImmediate(() => {
     console.log('Immediate');
   });

   console.log('End');
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   Start
   End
   Next Tick
   Immediate
   ```

### 107. **What is a stream in Node.js, and what are its types?**
   **Answer:**  
   A **stream** in Node.js is an abstract interface for handling streaming data. Streams are used to process data piece by piece, without having to load the entire dataset into memory, which makes them efficient for handling large data sources.

   **Types of Streams:**
   1. **Readable Streams**: Streams from which data can be read (e.g., `fs.createReadStream` for reading files).
   2. **Writable Streams**: Streams to which data can be written (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream` for writing files).
   3. **Duplex Streams**: Streams that are both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets).
   4. **Transform Streams**: Duplex streams where the output is computed based on the input (e.g., zlib streams for compression).

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');

   // Creating a readable stream
   const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');

   // Creating a writable stream
   const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

   // Piping the readable stream to the writable stream
   readableStream.pipe(writableStream);
   ```

   **Common Use Cases:**
   - **Reading and Writing Files**: Efficiently handle large files by processing them in chunks.
   - **Network Communication**: Streams are used to handle incoming and outgoing data over TCP or HTTP connections.
   - **Data Transformation**: Transform streams can be used to modify data as it is read or written, such as compressing files on the fly.

### 108. **How does Node.js handle child processes, and what are the different methods for creating them?**
   **Answer:**  
   Node.js provides the `child_process` module to spawn child processes, allowing you to execute shell commands, scripts, or other Node.js instances within your application. This is useful for tasks like running external programs or performing CPU-intensive work in a separate process.

   **Methods for Creating Child Processes:**
   1. **`spawn`**: Launches a new process with a given command. The `spawn` method is asynchronous and streams data between the parent and child processes.
      ```javascript
      const { spawn } = require('child_process');
      const child = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);

      child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
        console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
      });

      child.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
        console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
      });

      child.on('close', (code) => {
        console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
      });
      ```

   2. **`exec`**: Executes a command in a shell and buffers the output. This is useful for simpler commands that don’t require a stream interface.
      ```javascript
      const { exec } = require('child_process');
      exec('ls -lh /usr', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
        if (error) {
          console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
          return;
        }
        console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
        console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
      });
      ```

   3. **`fork`**: Specifically used to spawn new Node.js processes. It is similar to `spawn` but uses the same Node.js executable and establishes a communication channel between the parent and child process using IPC (Inter-Process Communication).
      ```javascript
      const { fork } = require('child_process');
      const child = fork('child.js');

      child.on('message', (message) => {
        console.log(`Received message from child: ${message}`);
      });

      child.send('Hello from parent');
      ```

   4. **`execFile`**: Executes a binary or an executable file directly, without using a shell. It’s more efficient and secure than `exec` for running binary files.
      ```javascript
      const { execFile } = require('child_process');
      execFile('node', ['--version'], (error, stdout, stderr) => {
        if (error) {
          console.error(`execFile error: ${error}`);
          return;
        }
        console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
        console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
      });
      ```

   **Use Cases:**
   - **Running External Programs**: Automating tasks like deploying applications, running scripts, or interacting with system tools.
   - **Parallel Processing**: Offloading CPU-intensive tasks to child processes to avoid blocking the event loop in the main process.
   - **Modular Architecture**: Running separate Node.js processes for different components of an application and communicating between them using IPC.

### 109. **What are worker threads in Node.js, and how do they differ from child processes?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Worker threads** in Node.js provide a way to create multiple threads within a single process, allowing you to run JavaScript code in parallel without creating separate processes. They are ideal for performing CPU-intensive tasks that would otherwise block the event loop.

   **Key Differences Between Worker Threads and Child Processes:**
   - **Memory**: Worker threads share the same memory space, which makes data sharing faster and more efficient. Child processes have separate memory spaces, which requires more overhead for communication.
   - **Communication**: Worker threads communicate using `MessagePort` and `MessageChannel`, which are optimized for low-latency communication. Child processes use IPC (Inter-Process Communication) channels, which involve more overhead.
   - **Use Cases**: Worker threads are better suited for tasks like mathematical computations, data processing, or other CPU-bound tasks. Child processes are better for tasks that require isolation, such as running external programs or scripts.

   **Example Using Worker Threads:**
   ```javascript
   const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

   if (isMainThread) {
     const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
       workerData: 42
     });

     worker.on('message', (result) => {
       console.log(`Result from worker: ${result}`);
     });
   } else {
     const result = workerData * 2;
     parentPort.postMessage(result);
   }
   ```

   **Advantages of Worker Threads:**
   - **Low Overhead**: Since worker threads share memory, the overhead of communication between them is minimal compared to child processes.
   - **Parallel Execution**: Worker threads allow true parallel execution of code, which can significantly improve performance for CPU-bound tasks.
   - **Ease of Use**: Worker threads are easier to use for tasks that require frequent data sharing or quick communication between threads.

### 110. **How can you handle uncaught exceptions in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   In Node.js, an **uncaught exception** is an error that is not handled within the application’s code, leading to a crash. Handling uncaught exceptions is important to prevent your application from unexpectedly terminating.

   **Handling Uncaught Exceptions:**
   - **`process.on('uncaughtException')`:** You can listen for the `uncaughtException` event to catch errors that are not handled by any other part of your code.
     ```javascript
     process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
       console.error('There was an uncaught error', err);
       process.exit(1); // Exiting the process to avoid an inconsistent state
     });

     // Simulate an uncaught exception
     throw new Error('This will crash the application');
     ```

   **Best Practices:**
   - **Graceful Shutdown**: If an uncaught exception occurs, it is best to log the error and shut down the application gracefully. This prevents the application from running in an undefined state.
   - **Error Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools like Sentry, New Relic, or similar services to track and report uncaught exceptions.
   - **Avoid Over-reliance**: Relying on `uncaughtException` to handle errors is not recommended for regular error handling.

Certainly! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, starting from number 111.

### 111. **What are timers in Node.js, and how do they work?**
   **Answer:**  
   Timers in Node.js allow you to schedule functions to be executed after a set period of time. Node.js provides several functions for working with timers:

   - **`setTimeout(callback, delay)`**: Executes the `callback` function after a specified `delay` in milliseconds.
   - **`setInterval(callback, delay)`**: Repeatedly executes the `callback` function at intervals defined by the `delay`.
   - **`setImmediate(callback)`**: Executes the `callback` function immediately after the I/O events are processed in the current event loop iteration.
   - **`clearTimeout(timer)`**: Cancels a timeout set by `setTimeout`.
   - **`clearInterval(timer)`**: Cancels an interval set by `setInterval`.
   - **`clearImmediate(immediate)`**: Cancels an immediate timer set by `setImmediate`.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Before timeout');

   setTimeout(() => {
     console.log('This will run after 2 seconds');
   }, 2000);

   console.log('After timeout');
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   Before timeout
   After timeout
   This will run after 2 seconds
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - Timers are not guaranteed to execute exactly at the specified delay. The actual execution time may vary due to the event loop being blocked or other operations being executed.
   - `setImmediate()` executes a callback function in the next iteration of the event loop, whereas `process.nextTick()` executes a callback before any I/O events, but both are used for slightly different purposes.

### 112. **How does the `cluster` module in Node.js help in handling multiple connections?**
   **Answer:**  
   The **`cluster` module** in Node.js allows you to create multiple processes that share the same server port, enabling you to take advantage of multi-core systems by running multiple instances of your application. This can help you handle a large number of connections more efficiently by distributing the load across multiple processes.

   **Key Concepts:**
   - **Master Process**: The process that spawns worker processes.
   - **Worker Processes**: Child processes that handle incoming requests. Each worker is an instance of the Node.js application.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const cluster = require('cluster');
   const http = require('http');
   const os = require('os');

   if (cluster.isMaster) {
     const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;

     console.log(`Master process is running with PID: ${process.pid}`);
     // Fork workers for each CPU core
     for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
       cluster.fork();
     }

     cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
       console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died. Forking a new one.`);
       cluster.fork();
     });
   } else {
     // Worker processes have their own HTTP server
     http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200);
       res.end('Hello from Node.js Cluster!\n');
     }).listen(8000);

     console.log(`Worker process started with PID: ${process.pid}`);
   }
   ```

   **Advantages of Using the `cluster` Module:**
   - **Load Balancing**: The master process automatically distributes incoming connections among the workers, providing built-in load balancing.
   - **Fault Tolerance**: If a worker crashes, the master can fork a new worker to maintain the application's availability.
   - **Scalability**: Easily scale the application across multiple CPU cores without changing the core application logic.

   **Use Cases:**
   - High-traffic applications that need to handle thousands of concurrent connections.
   - Applications that need to maximize CPU usage by running on all available cores.

### 113. **Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js and its use in frameworks like Express.js.**
   **Answer:**  
   **Middleware** in Node.js refers to functions that have access to the request and response objects, as well as the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform a variety of tasks, such as modifying the request or response, ending the request-response cycle, or passing control to the next middleware function.

   **Types of Middleware in Express.js:**
   1. **Application-level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of the Express app and can be applied globally or to specific routes.
   2. **Router-level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of an Express router and can be applied to specific routes managed by that router.
   3. **Error-handling Middleware**: Specifically designed to handle errors that occur during the processing of requests.
   4. **Built-in Middleware**: Provided by Express, such as `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` for parsing incoming request bodies.
   5. **Third-party Middleware**: External modules that can be integrated into Express applications, such as `morgan` for logging or `cors` for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

   **Example of Middleware in Express.js:**
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Application-level middleware
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log(`Request Method: ${req.method}, Request URL: ${req.url}`);
     next(); // Pass control to the next middleware function
   });

   // Route-specific middleware
   const checkAuth = (req, res, next) => {
     if (req.query.auth === 'true') {
       next(); // User is authenticated, proceed to the next middleware
     } else {
       res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
     }
   };

   app.get('/secure', checkAuth, (req, res) => {
     res.send('You have accessed a secure route!');
   });

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Order Matters**: Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined. This allows you to create a stack of middleware functions that process requests in a specific sequence.
   - **Modularity**: Middleware allows you to separate concerns and keep your code modular. For example, you can have separate middleware for authentication, logging, error handling, etc.
   - **Reusability**: Middleware functions can be reused across different routes or even across different applications.

### 114. **What is the `dns` module in Node.js, and how is it used?**
   **Answer:**  
   The **`dns` module** in Node.js provides functions to perform DNS (Domain Name System) resolution, which is the process of converting domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. The `dns` module can be used for network-related tasks, such as looking up DNS records, resolving domain names to IP addresses, or performing reverse DNS lookups.

   **Key Functions in the `dns` Module:**
   - **`dns.lookup(hostname, [options], callback)`**: Resolves a domain name (hostname) to an IP address. This function uses the operating system's underlying DNS resolver.
   - **`dns.resolve(hostname, [rrtype], callback)`**: Resolves a domain name to an array of resource records of the specified type (e.g., 'A', 'MX', 'TXT').
   - **`dns.reverse(ip, callback)`**: Performs a reverse DNS lookup that resolves an IP address to an array of hostnames.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const dns = require('dns');

   // Lookup a domain name
   dns.lookup('example.com', (err, address, family) => {
     if (err) throw err;
     console.log(`IP Address: ${address}, Family: IPv${family}`);
   });

   // Resolve DNS records
   dns.resolve('example.com', 'A', (err, addresses) => {
     if (err) throw err;
     console.log(`A Records: ${JSON.stringify(addresses)}`);
   });

   // Reverse DNS lookup
   dns.reverse('93.184.216.34', (err, hostnames) => {
     if (err) throw err;
     console.log(`Reverse lookup for IP 93.184.216.34: ${JSON.stringify(hostnames)}`);
   });
   ```

   **Use Cases:**
   - **Network Applications**: Applications that need to interact with DNS servers, such as web crawlers, network utilities, or email clients.
   - **Hostname Resolution**: Converting domain names to IP addresses when establishing connections to remote servers.
   - **Reverse Lookups**: Performing reverse DNS lookups to find the domain name associated with a given IP address, useful for logging or auditing purposes.

Certainly! Here are more Node.js interview questions and answers, starting from number 115.

### 115. **What is event-driven programming in Node.js, and how does it relate to the EventEmitter class?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Event-driven programming** is a programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events, such as user actions, messages from other programs, or sensor outputs. In Node.js, this paradigm is central due to its asynchronous, non-blocking nature.

   **EventEmitter Class:**
   - The **`EventEmitter`** class is a core module in Node.js that facilitates event-driven programming. It allows you to create objects that emit named events. When an event is emitted, any functions (listeners) that are subscribed to that event are called synchronously in the order they were registered.
   - `EventEmitter` is used extensively in Node.js, especially in streams, HTTP servers, and other asynchronous operations.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const EventEmitter = require('events');

   class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

   const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

   // Register an event listener
   myEmitter.on('event', () => {
     console.log('An event occurred!');
   });

   // Emit the event
   myEmitter.emit('event');
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Multiple Listeners:** You can attach multiple listeners to the same event.
   - **Custom Events:** You can define custom events that your application can emit and handle.
   - **Error Handling:** It's common to listen for an 'error' event and handle it properly to avoid unhandled exceptions.
   - **Removing Listeners:** You can remove event listeners using `removeListener` or `off`.

### 116. **What is the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   Both `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` are used to schedule the execution of callback functions, but they have different timings in the Node.js event loop.

   - **`process.nextTick()`**: 
     - Schedules the callback to be invoked immediately after the current operation completes, before the event loop continues.
     - It has higher priority and will be executed before any I/O operations.
     - Can cause the event loop to be blocked if used excessively in a recursive manner.

   - **`setImmediate()`**: 
     - Schedules the callback to be executed on the next iteration of the event loop, after I/O operations are completed.
     - Provides a way to defer execution until the current event loop iteration completes.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Start');

   process.nextTick(() => {
     console.log('Next Tick');
   });

   setImmediate(() => {
     console.log('Immediate');
   });

   console.log('End');
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   Start
   End
   Next Tick
   Immediate
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - `process.nextTick()` is useful for deferring the execution of a function until the current function completes, often used in asynchronous patterns.
   - `setImmediate()` is better suited for allowing the event loop to continue and perform I/O operations before executing the callback.

### 117. **Explain the `crypto` module in Node.js and provide an example of how to hash a password.**
   **Answer:**  
   The **`crypto` module** in Node.js provides cryptographic functionality that includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL’s hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify functions.

   **Common Uses of the `crypto` Module:**
   - **Hashing**: Creating a fixed-size hash value from arbitrary data, often used for storing passwords.
   - **Encryption/Decryption**: Securely encrypting and decrypting data.
   - **Digital Signatures**: Creating and verifying digital signatures.

   **Example of Hashing a Password:**
   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');

   const password = 'mySecretPassword';
   const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(password).digest('hex');

   console.log(`Password: ${password}`);
   console.log(`Hashed Password: ${hash}`);
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Hashing Algorithms:** The `crypto` module supports various hashing algorithms such as 'sha256', 'sha512', 'md5', etc.
   - **Salt:** Always use a salt (random data added to the password) when hashing passwords to protect against rainbow table attacks.
   - **HMAC:** Use `crypto.createHmac()` for generating a keyed-hash message authentication code, which provides additional security.

### 118. **What is the purpose of `Streams` in Node.js, and what are the different types of streams?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Streams** in Node.js are objects that allow you to read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous manner. They are particularly useful for working with large amounts of data, such as reading files, making HTTP requests, or interacting with databases, as they process data piece by piece instead of loading it all into memory at once.

   **Types of Streams:**
   - **Readable Streams**: Used for reading data, e.g., `fs.createReadStream()`.
   - **Writable Streams**: Used for writing data, e.g., `fs.createWriteStream()`.
   - **Duplex Streams**: Both readable and writable, e.g., network sockets.
   - **Transform Streams**: Duplex streams that can modify or transform the data as it is read or written, e.g., `zlib.createGzip()` for compression.

   **Example of Reading a File Using Streams:**
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');

   const readStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });

   readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
     console.log('New chunk received:');
     console.log(chunk);
   });

   readStream.on('end', () => {
     console.log('File read completed.');
   });

   readStream.on('error', (err) => {
     console.error('Error reading file:', err);
   });
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Memory Efficiency:** Streams are memory-efficient because they process data chunk by chunk, making them ideal for handling large files.
   - **Piping:** You can pipe the output of one stream to another, e.g., reading from a file and writing to another file or a network socket.
   - **Event-Driven:** Streams are event-driven, using events like `data`, `end`, and `error` to handle data as it becomes available.

### 119. **What is middleware in Express.js, and how does it work?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Middleware** in Express.js refers to functions that have access to the request and response objects, as well as the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware can perform a variety of tasks, such as executing code, modifying the request or response objects, ending the request-response cycle, or calling the next middleware function.

   **Types of Middleware:**
   - **Application-Level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of the Express app using `app.use()`.
   - **Router-Level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of an Express router.
   - **Error-Handling Middleware**: Defined with four arguments and used for handling errors.
   - **Built-In Middleware**: Provided by Express, such as `express.json()` and `express.static()`.
   - **Third-Party Middleware**: Middleware that is developed and maintained by the community, such as `morgan` for logging or `body-parser` for parsing request bodies.

   **Example of Middleware in Express.js:**
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Application-level middleware
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log('Request received at:', new Date());
     next(); // Passes control to the next middleware or route handler
   });

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   // Error-handling middleware
   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
     console.error(err.stack);
     res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Order of Execution:** Middleware functions execute in the order they are defined. This allows you to create a stack of middleware functions that handle requests sequentially.
   - **`next()` Function:** The `next()` function is crucial for passing control to the next middleware function in the stack. If `next()` is not called, the request-response cycle will be terminated prematurely.
   - **Error Handling:** If an error occurs, you can pass an error object to `next(err)` to trigger the error-handling middleware.

### 120. **Explain the `fs` module in Node.js and its common uses.**
   **Answer:**  
   The **`fs` (File System)** module in Node.js provides an API for interacting with the file system in a manner closely modeled around standard POSIX functions. It allows you to perform various file operations, such as reading, writing, updating, and deleting files.

   **Commonly Used Methods in the `fs` Module:**
   - **`fs.readFile(path, [options], callback)`**: Asynchronously reads the entire contents of a file.
   - **`fs.writeFile(file, data, [options], callback)`**: Asynchronously writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists.
   - **`fs.appendFile(path, data, [options], callback)`**: Asynchronously appends data to a file, creating the file if it does not exist.
   - **`fs.unlink(path, callback)`**: Asynchronously deletes a file.
   - **`fs.rename(oldPath, newPath, callback)`**: Renames a file or directory.

   **Example of Reading a File:**
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');

   fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error(err);
       return;
     }
     console.log(data);
   });
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Synchronous vs Asynchronous:** The `fs` module provides both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) methods. It's recommended to use asynchronous methods to avoid blocking the event loop.
   - **Streams:** For large files, using streams (`fs.createReadStream` and `fs.createWriteStream`) is more efficient as they handle data in chunks, reducing memory usage.
   - **Error Handling:** Always handle errors, especially when dealing with file operations, to avoid crashes.

### 121. **What is the difference between `fs.readFileSync()` and `fs.readFile()` in Node.js?**
   **Answer:**  
   The primary difference between `fs.readFileSync()` and `fs.readFile()` is in how they handle file reading operations in Node.js.

   - **`fs.readFile()`**:
     - Asynchronous, non-blocking.
     - It reads the file asynchronously and takes a callback function that is called when the operation is complete.
     - Does not block the event loop, allowing other code to execute while the file is being read.

     **Example:**
     ```javascript
     fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(data);
     });
     ```

   - **`fs.readFileSync()`**:
     - Synchronous, blocking.
     - It reads the file synchronously and returns the contents. The operation blocks the event loop until the file is read completely.
     - Should be used cautiously, as it can block the event loop, leading to performance issues.

     **Example:**
     ```javascript
     try {
       const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
       console.log(data);
     } catch (err) {
       console.error(err);
     }
     ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Use Cases:** Use `fs.readFile()` for asynchronous operations where you don't want to block the event loop, and `fs.readFileSync()` in scenarios where blocking is acceptable, like during application startup or in scripts.
   - **Performance:** Asynchronous methods are preferred in Node.js for better performance and responsiveness, especially in a production environment.

### 122. **How do you handle file uploads in Node.js using `multer`?**
   **Answer:**  
   **`multer`** is a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files in Node.js. It allows you to handle file uploads easily by processing incoming files and saving them to the disk or memory.

   **Steps to Handle File Uploads:**
   1. **Install Multer:**
      ```bash
      npm install multer
      ```

   2. **Set Up Multer in Your Express Application:**
      ```javascript
      const express = require('express');
      const multer = require('multer');
      const app = express();

      // Configure storage
      const storage = multer.diskStorage({
        destination: (req, file, cb) => {
          cb(null, 'uploads/'); // Directory to save uploaded files
        },
        filename: (req, file, cb) => {
          cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname); // Unique filename
        }
      });

      // Initialize multer
      const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

      // Define a route for file uploads
      app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
        res.send('File uploaded successfully');
      });

      app.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log('Server started on port 3000');
      });
      ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Single vs Multiple File Uploads:** `upload.single('file')` handles single file uploads, while `upload.array('files', maxCount)` handles multiple file uploads.
   - **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors in file uploads, such as unsupported file types or size limits, using middleware.
   - **Security Considerations:** Always validate and sanitize filenames, and consider limiting file types and sizes to prevent abuse.

### 123. **What are worker threads in Node.js, and how are they used?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Worker threads** in Node.js are a feature that allows the execution of JavaScript code in parallel threads. They are useful for performing CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main event loop, enabling better performance for computationally heavy operations.

   **When to Use Worker Threads:**
   - **CPU-Bound Tasks:** Ideal for tasks like image processing, complex calculations, or data parsing.
   - **Isolated Environments:** Each worker thread runs in its own V8 instance, making them isolated from the main thread.

   **Example of Using Worker Threads:**
   ```javascript
   const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

   if (isMainThread) {
     // Main thread
     const worker = new Worker(__filename);
     worker.on('message', (message) => {
       console.log('Message from worker:', message);
     });
     worker.postMessage('Hello, Worker!');
   } else {
     // Worker thread
     parentPort.on('message', (message) => {
       parentPort.postMessage(`Received: ${message}`);
     });
   }
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Communication:** Main threads and worker threads communicate using message passing, which can be done through `postMessage` and `on('message')` handlers.
   - **Memory:** Each worker thread has its own memory heap, so data needs to be passed between threads rather than shared directly.
   - **Limitations:** Not all Node.js APIs are available inside worker threads; they are typically used for heavy computation rather than I/O operations.

### 124. **What is clustering in Node.js, and how does it improve performance?**
   **Answer:**  
   **Clustering** in Node.js is a technique used to scale a Node.js application across multiple CPU cores. Since Node.js is single-threaded, it can only use one CPU core at a time. Clustering allows the creation of multiple instances (workers) of the Node.js application, each running on its own CPU core, thereby improving performance and handling more requests concurrently.

   **How Clustering Works:**
   - **Master Process:** The master process controls and manages worker processes. It listens for incoming connections and distributes them to the workers.
   - **Worker Processes:** Worker processes handle the actual incoming requests. Each worker is an independent Node.js process with its own event loop.

   **Example Using `cluster` Module:**
   ```javascript
   const cluster = require('cluster');
   const http = require('http');
   const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

   if (cluster.isMaster) {
     // Fork workers
     for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
       cluster.fork();
     }

     cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
       console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
       cluster.fork(); // Replace the dead worker
     });
   } else {
     // Workers can share any TCP connection
     http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200);
       res.end('Hello, World!\n');
     }).listen(8000);
   }
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Load Balancing:** Clustering helps in load balancing by distributing incoming connections across multiple workers.
   - **Fault Tolerance:** If a worker crashes, the master process can detect it and spawn a new worker to replace it.
   - **Sticky Sessions:** For stateful sessions, additional configuration (such as sticky sessions) might be required to ensure that subsequent requests from the same client are handled by the same worker.
