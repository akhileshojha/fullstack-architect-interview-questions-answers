     <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
     <script>
       const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
       const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
       ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
       ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 75);
     </script>
     ```
     This code creates a red rectangle on the canvas.

#### 4. **What are Web Storage APIs in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What are the Web Storage APIs in HTML5, and how do they differ from cookies?
   - **Answer:** Web Storage APIs in HTML5 provide a way to store data locally in the user's browser. There are two types:
     - **Local Storage:** Stores data with no expiration date.
     - **Session Storage:** Stores data for the duration of the page session.
     
     Unlike cookies, Web Storage allows for storing more data (up to 5-10 MB), and the data is not sent to the server with each HTTP request. Itâ€™s a more efficient way to handle local data.

#### 5. **Explain the role of the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements in HTML5.**
   - **Question:** What are the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements in HTML5, and how do they enhance multimedia support?
   - **Answer:** The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements in HTML5 allow developers to embed video and audio files directly into web pages without needing third-party plugins like Flash. They provide native support for controls (play, pause, volume), and developers can manipulate these elements using JavaScript. Example:
     ```html
     <video width="320" height="240" controls>
       <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
       Your browser does not support the video tag.
     </video>

     <audio controls>
       <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
       Your browser does not support the audio element.
     </audio>
     ```

#### 6. **What is the difference between `<article>` and `<section>` in HTML5?**

   - **Answer:** 
     - **`<article>`:** Represents a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.
     - **`<section>`:** Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. It is used to group related content together within a document.
     
     The main difference is that `<article>` is for content that makes sense on its own, while `<section>` is for organizing content within a page or document.

#### 7. **How does the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` element pair work in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What is the purpose of the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements in HTML5?
   - **Answer:** The `<figure>` element is used to group media content like images, diagrams, or code snippets, along with a caption provided by the `<figcaption>` element. The caption is typically placed within the `<figure>` tag. This helps provide context to the media content and makes it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to interpret.
     ```html
     <figure>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="A scenic view">
       <figcaption>A beautiful scenic view</figcaption>
     </figure>
     ```

#### 8. **What is the purpose of the `data-*` attributes in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What are `data-*` attributes in HTML5, and how are they used?
   - **Answer:** The `data-*` attributes in HTML5 are custom data attributes that allow developers to store extra information on HTML elements. These attributes are useful for embedding custom data in an element, which can then be accessed via JavaScript. Example:
     ```html
     <div id="user" data-id="12345" data-role="admin">John Doe</div>
     <script>
       const userDiv = document.getElementById('user');
       console.log(userDiv.dataset.id);  // Outputs: 12345
       console.log(userDiv.dataset.role); // Outputs: admin
     </script>
     ```

#### 9. **What is the purpose of the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 forms?**
   - **Question:** What is the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used in form elements?
   - **Answer:** The `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 is used to provide a hint or example text inside a form input element, guiding the user on what to enter. The text disappears when the user starts typing. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
     ```
     This input field will display "Enter your name" until the user begins to type.

#### 10. **How does HTML5 support offline web applications?**
   - **Question:** Explain how HTML5 enables offline web applications.
   - **Answer:** HTML5 provides support for offline web applications through the Application Cache (AppCache) and the newer Service Workers. 
     - **AppCache:** Allows developers to specify resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images) that the browser should cache, so the application can load and function without an internet connection.
     - **Service Workers:** A more powerful and flexible way to handle offline functionality, service workers act as a proxy between the web application and the network, allowing for advanced caching strategies, background sync, and push notifications.

These questions cover fundamental aspects of HTML5, offering a strong foundation for any interview focusing on modern web development.

   - **Answer:** The `required` attribute in HTML5 is used to indicate that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form. If the user tries to submit the form without filling out the required fields, the browser will automatically display a validation message. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="username" required>
     ```
     This field must be filled out before the form can be submitted.

#### 13. **How do you create a responsive web design using HTML5?**
   - **Question:** How can HTML5 be used to create a responsive web design?
   - **Answer:** Responsive web design can be achieved using HTML5 along with CSS3. Key techniques include:
     - **Viewport Meta Tag:** Ensures the layout adjusts to the device's screen size.
       ```html
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       ```
     - **Media Queries:** CSS3 media queries allow different styles to be applied based on screen size, orientation, and resolution.
     - **Fluid Grid Layouts:** Use percentage-based widths rather than fixed pixel values to allow the layout to resize fluidly.
     - **Flexible Images and Media:** Images and other media should scale with the grid using CSS properties like `max-width: 100%`.

#### 14. **What is the difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Compare `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** Both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are part of the Web Storage API in HTML5, used for storing data on the client side.
     - **`localStorage`:** Stores data with no expiration time, meaning the data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. It is useful for storing long-term data.
     - **`sessionStorage`:** Stores data that is only available during the page session. The data is deleted once the page session ends, such as when the browser tab is closed. It is suitable for temporary data that doesn't need to persist.

#### 15. **Explain the `progress` element in HTML5.**
   - **Question:** What is the purpose of the `progress` element in HTML5?
   - **Answer:** The `progress` element in HTML5 represents the completion progress of a task, such as downloading a file or loading a page. It provides a visual indicator of the progress and can be used with JavaScript to dynamically update the value. Example:
     ```html
     <progress value="70" max="100">70%</progress>
     ```
     This code displays a progress bar that is 70% complete.

#### 16. **What are HTML5 data attributes, and how do you use them?**
   - **Question:** What are `data-*` attributes in HTML5, and how are they utilized?
   - **Answer:** HTML5 `data-*` attributes allow developers to embed custom data within HTML elements. These attributes start with `data-` followed by a custom name, and they can store information that can be accessed via JavaScript. Example:
     ```html
     <div data-user-id="12345" data-role="admin">John Doe</div>
     <script>
       const user = document.querySelector('div');
       console.log(user.dataset.userId); // Outputs: 12345
       console.log(user.dataset.role);   // Outputs: admin
     </script>
     ```
     `data-*` attributes are commonly used for storing metadata that doesn't need to be displayed but is required for scripting purposes.

#### 17. **What are the new graphic elements introduced in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Name and describe the new graphic elements introduced in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** HTML5 introduces the following graphic elements:
     - **`<canvas>`:** Provides a drawing surface that allows for 2D graphics, animations, and other visual content using JavaScript.
     - **`<svg>` (Scalable Vector Graphics):** A language for describing 2D graphics in XML. It is used for rendering vector-based graphics directly in the browser.
     
     Both `<canvas>` and `<svg>` are used for rendering graphics, but they serve different purposes. `<canvas>` is bitmap-based and suited for dynamic content, while `<svg>` is vector-based and better for static or interactive graphics that need to scale.

#### 18. **How does the `placeholder` attribute enhance form usability in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What is the `placeholder` attribute, and how does it enhance form usability in HTML5?
   - **Answer:** The `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 is used to provide a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field. This text appears inside the input field until the user starts typing, offering guidance on what to enter. It improves form usability by providing context without the need for separate labels or instructions. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your username">
     ```

#### 19. **What is the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 is used to automatically focus an input field or textarea when the page loads, meaning the cursor will be placed in that field without the user having to click on it. This attribute enhances user experience by directing attention to the most important or first input field. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="username" autofocus>
     ```

#### 20. **What are the advantages of using the `<nav>` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What is the `<nav>` element in HTML5, and what are its advantages?
   - **Answer:** The `<nav>` element in HTML5 is used to define a block of navigation links. It is a semantic element that helps structure the page's navigation and improves accessibility and SEO. By using `<nav>`, screen readers and search engines can easily identify and prioritize the site's navigation structure. Example:
     ```html
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
         <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
     ```

### HTML5 Interview Questions and Answers

#### 21. **What is the `datalist` element in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `datalist` element in HTML5 and its purpose.
   - **Answer:** The `datalist` element in HTML5 provides an autocomplete feature on input elements. It contains a set of `<option>` elements that represent possible values for the corresponding `<input>` element. As the user types into the input field, the browser shows a dropdown list of the available options. Example:
     ```html
     <input list="browsers" name="browser" id="browser">
     <datalist id="browsers">
       <option value="Chrome">
       <option value="Firefox">
       <option value="Safari">
       <option value="Edge">
       <option value="Opera">
     </datalist>
     ```
     This creates a text input field with a dropdown list of browsers.

#### 22. **What is the difference between `section` and `div` elements in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `section` and `div` elements in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `section` and `div` elements are both used to group content in HTML5, but they have different purposes:
     - **`<section>`:** This is a semantic element used to group related content into a section, typically with a heading. It's meant to indicate a standalone section of content that could be independently reusable.
     - **`<div>`:** This is a non-semantic element used purely for styling or scripting purposes. It doesn't carry any meaning about the content it encloses.
     
     Using `<section>` instead of `<div>` can improve accessibility and SEO by providing more context to search engines and assistive technologies.

#### 23. **What are custom elements in HTML5, and how do you create one?**
   - **Question:** What are custom elements in HTML5, and how can you create a custom element?
   - **Answer:** Custom elements in HTML5 allow developers to define their own HTML tags and behaviors, encapsulating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a reusable component. To create a custom element, you typically extend the HTMLElement class in JavaScript and define its behavior using the Custom Elements API. Example:
     ```javascript
     class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement {
       constructor() {
         super();
         this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
         this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<p>Hello, world!</p>`;
       }
     }
     customElements.define('my-custom-element', MyCustomElement);
     ```
     You can then use `<my-custom-element></my-custom-element>` in your HTML.

#### 24. **Explain the `figure` and `figcaption` elements in HTML5.**
   - **Question:** What are the `figure` and `figcaption` elements in HTML5, and how are they used?
   - **Answer:** The `figure` element is used to group media content like images, diagrams, or illustrations, along with their associated captions, provided by the `figcaption` element. The content inside a `figure` is typically referenced in the main content, but it can be moved or removed without affecting the content flow. Example:
     ```html
     <figure>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
       <figcaption>This is a sample image.</figcaption>
     </figure>
     ```
     This markup provides a semantic structure for images and their captions.

#### 25. **What is the purpose of the `mark` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `mark` element in HTML5 and its use case.
   - **Answer:** The `mark` element in HTML5 is used to highlight text that is of particular relevance or importance within a larger context, like search results or keywords in a document. The text within the `mark` tag is typically rendered with a yellow background by default. Example:
     ```html
     <p>This is an <mark>important</mark> word in the sentence.</p>
     ```
     The word "important" would be highlighted in the sentence.

#### 26. **What is the `main` element in HTML5, and why is it important?**
   - **Question:** Explain the purpose of the `main` element in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `main` element in HTML5 is used to encapsulate the primary content of a webpage, distinguishing it from content that is repeated across pages like headers, footers, or sidebars. This helps search engines and assistive technologies quickly identify the core content. Example:
     ```html
     <main>
       <h1>Main Content</h1>
       <p>This is the main area of the webpage.</p>
     </main>
     ```
     Using `<main>` improves the structure and accessibility of web pages.

#### 27. **What is the `output` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `output` element in HTML5 and when it should be used.
   - **Answer:** The `output` element in HTML5 is used to represent the result of a calculation or user action, often in forms or interactive applications. It is linked to a form control using the `for` attribute. Example:
     ```html
     <form oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
       <input type="number" id="a" value="50"> +
       <input type="number" id="b" value="100">
       <output name="result" for="a b">150</output>
     </form>
     ```
     This shows how `output` can be used to display the result of adding two numbers.

#### 28. **How does the `details` and `summary` elements work in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `details` and `summary` elements in HTML5 and how they interact.
   - **Answer:** The `details` element in HTML5 creates a collapsible content area that can be expanded or collapsed by the user. The `summary` element, which must be the first child of `details`, provides a visible heading that users can click to toggle the visibility of the content. Example:
     ```html
     <details>
       <summary>More Information</summary>
       <p>This is the content that is initially hidden and can be expanded.</p>
     </details>
     ```
     When the user clicks on "More Information," the content is revealed.

#### 29. **What are semantic elements in HTML5, and why are they important?**
   - **Question:** What are semantic elements in HTML5, and what benefits do they offer?
   - **Answer:** Semantic elements in HTML5 are HTML tags that provide meaning about the content enclosed within them, rather than just presentation. Examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`. These elements improve the readability of the code, provide better accessibility, and enhance SEO by giving search engines more context about the structure and content of the webpage.

#### 30. **What is the `template` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `template` element in HTML5 and its typical usage.
   - **Answer:** The `template` element in HTML5 is used to define HTML content that is not to be rendered when the page loads, but can be used later in the document through JavaScript. It's useful for client-side templating, where you may need to clone or insert content dynamically. Example:
     ```html
     <template id="my-template">
       <p>This is a template content.</p>
     </template>
     <script>
       let template = document.getElementById('my-template').content.cloneNode(true);
       document.body.appendChild(template);
     </script>
     ```
     This allows you to define reusable content that can be injected into the DOM at runtime.

These questions continue to cover essential aspects of HTML5, focusing on elements that enhance the structure, usability, and interactivity of modern web pages.

   - **Answer:** The `progress` element in HTML5 represents the completion progress of a task, such as a file upload or a download. It is a visual indicator of progress, with a value attribute specifying the current progress and a max attribute specifying the maximum value. Example:
     ```html
     <progress value="70" max="100">70%</progress>
     ```
     This code creates a progress bar that is 70% complete. The `progress` element is particularly useful for showing progress in forms or other tasks in a web application.

#### 32. **What is the `meter` element in HTML5, and how is it different from `progress`?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `meter` element in HTML5 and how it differs from the `progress` element.
   - **Answer:** The `meter` element in HTML5 represents a scalar measurement within a known range, such as disk usage, temperature, or a voting result. Unlike the `progress` element, which shows task completion, the `meter` is used to indicate a value within a range. Example:
     ```html
     <meter value="0.6" min="0" max="1">60%</meter>
     ```
     This creates a meter that shows 60% of the maximum value. The `meter` element is more appropriate when representing a bounded value, while `progress` is used for showing task progress.

#### 33. **What is the `nav` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `nav` element in HTML5 and when it should be used.
   - **Answer:** The `nav` element in HTML5 is a semantic element used to define a section of a page intended for navigation links, such as a site's primary menu or a list of links to other pages. Example:
     ```html
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
         <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
     ```
     This element helps to group navigational links, improving both accessibility and SEO by clearly defining the purpose of the content within the `nav` element.

#### 34. **How does the `time` element work in HTML5, and what are its benefits?**
   - **Question:** What is the `time` element in HTML5, and what are its use cases?

     ```html
     <time datetime="2024-08-17">August 17, 2024</time>
     ```
     This marks up a date, allowing search engines and other tools to recognize it as a date rather than just plain text. The `time` element enhances accessibility and provides meaningful context to the content.

#### 35. **What is the purpose of the `wbr` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `wbr` element in HTML5 and its usage.
   - **Answer:** The `wbr` (Word Break Opportunity) element in HTML5 specifies where in a long word or string it would be okay to break and wrap to the next line. It does not force a line break but allows the browser to break the line if necessary. Example:
     ```html
     <p>Thisisaverylongword<wbr>thatmightneedtobreak.</p>
     ```
     If the long word needs to wrap due to space constraints, the browser will break the word at the `wbr` point.

#### 36. **What is the `article` element in HTML5, and how is it different from `section`?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `article` and `section` elements in HTML5.

         <h3>Section 2</h3>
         <p>Content of section 2.</p>
       </section>
     </article>
     ```
     Use `article` for standalone content, and `section` for thematically grouped content.

#### 37. **What is the `aside` element in HTML5, and how should it be used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `aside` element in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `aside` element in HTML5 is used for content that is related to the main content but is not part of the primary narrative flow, such as sidebars, pull quotes, or related links. Example:
     ```html
     <article>
       <h2>Main Content</h2>
       <p>This is the main content of the article.</p>
       <aside>
         <p>Related link: <a href="#">Read more about this topic</a>.</p>
       </aside>
     </article>
     ```
     Content in the `aside` element is supplementary to the main content and is often positioned as a sidebar.

#### 38. **How do you include audio files in a webpage using HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain how to embed audio files in a webpage using the `audio` element in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `audio` element in HTML5 is used to embed sound content into a webpage. You can specify multiple source files with different formats to ensure compatibility across browsers. Example:
     ```html
     <audio controls>
       <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
       <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
       Your browser does not support the audio element.

     ```
     This code provides a dropdown list of browser options while still allowing users to type in other values.

#### 49. **What is the `form` attribute in HTML5, and how does it differ from previous HTML versions?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `form` attribute in HTML5 and how it differs from previous HTML forms.
   - **Answer:** The `form` attribute in HTML5 allows form controls (`input`, `button`, `select`, etc.) to be associated with a form that is not their immediate ancestor. This means form elements can be placed outside of the `form` tag but still be associated with it. Example:
     ```html
     <form id="myForm">
       <input type="text" name="username">
     </form>
     <input type="submit" form="myForm" value="Submit">
     ```
     The submit button is outside the form but still submits the data from the form with ID `myForm`.

#### 50. **How do you use the `required` attribute in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `required` attribute in HTML5 and its effect on form elements.
   - **Answer:** The `required` attribute in HTML5 is used to indicate that a form field must be filled out before submitting the form. It can be applied to `input`, `textarea`, and `select` elements. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="username" required>
     ```
     This input field must be filled out before the form can be submitted, enforcing basic form validation directly in the browser.

These questions cover a range of HTML5 features, focusing on form elements, attributes, and their roles in enhancing user experience and form functionality.

       = <output name="result" for="a b">100</output>
     </form>
     ```
     The `output` element is useful for displaying dynamic results directly on the page.

#### 76. **What is the `autoplay` attribute in the `video` and `audio` elements in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `autoplay` attribute in the `video` and `audio` elements. How does it affect media playback?
   - **Answer:** The `autoplay` attribute in HTML5 specifies that the media (video or audio) should start playing automatically as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading. Example:
     ```html
     <video src="video.mp4" autoplay></video>
     ```
     Autoplay can enhance user experience by reducing interaction but should be used cautiously as it can be disruptive. Many browsers restrict autoplay functionality, especially when audio is present.

#### 77. **What is the `preload` attribute in the `video` and `audio` elements, and what values can it take?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `preload` attribute in HTML5 media elements and its possible values.
   - **Answer:** The `preload` attribute in HTML5 provides a hint to the browser about how much of the media file should be preloaded when the page loads. It can take the following values:
     - `none`: Do not preload any media data.
     - `metadata`: Preload only metadata (e.g., duration, dimensions).
     - `auto`: Preload the entire file (or as much as possible).
     Example:
     ```html
     <audio src="audio.mp3" preload="metadata"></audio>
     ```
     This helps manage the balance between faster playback and conserving data/bandwidth.

#### 78. **How does the `muted` attribute work in HTML5 media elements?**
   - **Question:** What is the purpose of the `muted` attribute in HTML5, and how is it typically used?
   - **Answer:** The `muted` attribute in HTML5 is used to mute the audio track of a video or audio element by default. When present, the media will start with its volume turned off. Example:
     ```html
     <video src="video.mp4" muted autoplay></video>
     ```
     This attribute is particularly useful in autoplay scenarios to avoid disrupting the user with unexpected sound.

#### 79. **What are the accessibility considerations when using HTML5 elements like `video` and `audio`?**
   - **Question:** Discuss the accessibility considerations for using `video` and `audio` elements in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** When using `video` and `audio` elements, it's important to provide alternative content or features for users with disabilities. Key considerations include:
     - **Captions/Subtitles**: For video content, provide captions or subtitles for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.
     - **Transcripts**: Provide a text transcript of the audio or video content.
     - **Controls**: Ensure that custom controls are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
     - **Alt Text**: For media that serves as content, provide a descriptive text alternative.
     Example:
     ```html
     <video controls>
       <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
       Your browser does not support the video tag. Here is a <a href="video.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
     </video>
     ```

#### 80. **What is the `track` element in HTML5, and how is it used with media elements?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `track` element in HTML5 and how it enhances media accessibility.
   - **Answer:** The `track` element in HTML5 is used to specify text tracks for media elements like `video` and `audio`. It can provide captions, subtitles, or descriptions, enhancing accessibility. The `track` element has several attributes like `kind`, `src`, `srclang`, and `label`. Example:
     ```html
     <video src="video.mp4" controls>
       <track src="subtitles_en.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
       <track src="subtitles_es.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="es" label="Spanish">
     </video>
     ```
     This allows users to choose subtitles in different languages, making the media more accessible.

### HTML5 Interview Questions and Answers

#### 81. **What is the `manifest` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `manifest` attribute in HTML5 and its purpose in web applications.
   - **Answer:** The `manifest` attribute in HTML5 is used to specify a file that lists resources for a web application to cache for offline use. This attribute is set on the `html` element and points to a manifest file containing URLs of resources that the browser should cache. Example:
     ```html
     <html manifest="app.appcache">
     ```
     The manifest file typically includes sections for caching resources, fallback mechanisms, and resources that should never be cached. This feature has been deprecated and replaced by service workers.

#### 82. **What is `localStorage` in HTML5, and how is it different from `sessionStorage`?**
   - **Question:** Compare `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** Both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are part of the Web Storage API, allowing websites to store data in the browser. The key differences are:
     - `localStorage`: Stores data with no expiration time, meaning the data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
     - `sessionStorage`: Stores data only for the duration of the page session; the data is cleared when the page session ends (i.e., when the browser tab is closed).
     Example:
     ```javascript
     localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
     sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
     ```

#### 83. **What is the `async` attribute in the `script` tag in HTML5, and how does it work?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `async` attribute in the HTML5 `script` tag and its effect on script loading.
   - **Answer:** The `async` attribute in the HTML5 `script` tag is used to load external JavaScript files asynchronously. When this attribute is present, the script will be fetched and executed as soon as it's available, without blocking the parsing of the rest of the page. Example:
     ```html
     <script src="script.js" async></script>
     ```
     The `async` attribute is particularly useful for loading scripts that don't depend on the DOM or other scripts, like analytics or tracking scripts.

#### 84. **What is the `defer` attribute in the `script` tag in HTML5, and how does it differ from `async`?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `defer` attribute in the HTML5 `script` tag and how it differs from `async`.
   - **Answer:** The `defer` attribute in the `script` tag ensures that the script is executed only after the HTML document has been fully parsed. Unlike `async`, which executes as soon as the script is available, `defer` scripts maintain their order relative to each other and execute after the document is ready. Example:
     ```html
     <script src="script.js" defer></script>
     ```
     This is ideal for scripts that need the DOM to be fully built before execution.

#### 85. **What is the purpose of the `datalist` element in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `datalist` element in HTML5 and its functionality.
   - **Answer:** The `datalist` element in HTML5 provides an autocomplete feature for form input elements. It contains a set of `option` elements that define the possible values for an associated `input` element. Example:
     ```html
     <input list="browsers" name="browser">
     <datalist id="browsers">
       <option value="Chrome">
       <option value="Firefox">
       <option value="Safari">
       <option value="Edge">
     </datalist>
     ```
     When the user starts typing in the input field, the browser suggests options from the `datalist`.

#### 86. **What are the `required` and `pattern` attributes in HTML5 forms, and how do they improve form validation?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `required` and `pattern` attributes in HTML5 and their role in form validation.
   - **Answer:** The `required` attribute in HTML5 makes an input field mandatory, preventing form submission unless the field is filled. The `pattern` attribute allows you to specify a regular expression that the input value must match. Together, these attributes enhance client-side form validation. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" required pattern="[A-Za-z]{3,}">
     ```
     This input field is mandatory and only accepts alphabetic characters with a minimum length of three.

#### 87. **What is the `progress` element in HTML5, and how is it different from the `meter` element?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `progress` and `meter` elements in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `progress` element in HTML5 represents the completion progress of a task, often used to show the progress of a file upload or a form submission. It is linear and reflects progress towards completion. The `meter` element, in contrast, represents a scalar measurement within a known range, such as a battery level or rating. Example:
     ```html
     <progress value="50" max="100"></progress>
     <meter value="0.6" min="0" max="1"></meter>
     ```
     `progress` is for tasks, while `meter` is for measurements.

#### 88. **What is the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5, and what is its purpose in form inputs?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 input elements.
   - **Answer:** The `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 provides a hint to the user about what to enter in the input field. It displays text inside the input field when it is empty, but it disappears once the user starts typing. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
     ```
     The `placeholder` attribute improves the user experience by providing contextual information directly within the input field.

#### 89. **What is the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used in forms?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 is used to automatically focus an input field when the page loads, saving the user from manually clicking into the field. Only one input field in a form can have the `autofocus` attribute. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" autofocus>
     ```
     This attribute is useful in forms where a specific field should be the first point of user interaction.

#### 90. **What is the `novalidate` attribute in HTML5 forms, and when would you use it?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `novalidate` attribute in HTML5 forms and its use case.
   - **Answer:** The `novalidate` attribute in HTML5 is used to disable the browser's built-in form validation when submitting a form. This attribute is useful when you want to handle form validation entirely through JavaScript or a server-side script. Example:
     ```html
     <form novalidate>
       <input type="email" required>
       <input type="submit">
     </form>
     ```
     With `novalidate`, the form can be submitted even if the email input is invalid according to the browser's rules.

   - **Question:** Describe the `output` element in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `output` element in HTML5 is used to represent the result of a calculation or user action within a form. It is often used in conjunction with JavaScript to display dynamic values such as the result of a calculation based on form inputs. Example:
     ```html
     <form oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
       <input type="range" id="a" value="50"> +
       <input type="number" id="b" value="50">
       <output name="result" for="a b">100</output>
     </form>
     ```
     Here, the `output` element shows the sum of the values of the two inputs.

#### 92. **What are the differences between HTML4 and HTML5 in terms of document structure and semantic elements?**
   - **Question:** Compare the document structure and semantic elements of HTML4 with those of HTML5.
   - **Answer:** HTML5 introduces several new structural and semantic elements that were not present in HTML4. In HTML4, developers often used generic `div` and `span` tags to structure content, leading to less semantic markup. HTML5 introduces new semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` to improve the clarity and meaning of the document structure. These elements help both developers and search engines better understand the content's purpose.
     Example in HTML4:
     ```html
     <div class="header"></div>
     <div class="content"></div>
     <div class="footer"></div>
     ```
     Equivalent in HTML5:
     ```html
     <header></header>
     <main></main>
     <footer></footer>
     ```

#### 93. **How does the `progress` element work in HTML5, and what attributes does it support?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `progress` element in HTML5 and the attributes it supports.
   - **Answer:** The `progress` element in HTML5 is used to represent the completion progress of a task, such as a file download or upload. It displays a progress bar that can be updated dynamically via JavaScript. The key attributes are `value` (current progress) and `max` (total value). Example:
     ```html
     <progress value="30" max="100"></progress>
     ```
     This creates a progress bar that is 30% complete. If the `max` attribute is omitted, it defaults to 1.

#### 94. **What is the `meter` element in HTML5, and when would you use it?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `meter` element in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `meter` element in HTML5 is used to represent a scalar measurement within a known range, such as a disk usage indicator or a rating. Unlike the `progress` element, which indicates progress toward completion, the `meter` element shows how a value compares to a range of possible values. Example:
     ```html
     <meter value="0.6" min="0" max="1" low="0.3" high="0.8" optimum="0.5"></meter>
     ```
     This creates a meter indicating a value of 0.6, with additional attributes to highlight what ranges are considered low, high, or optimum.

#### 95. **What are `web workers` in HTML5, and how do they help with performance?**
   - **Question:** Explain what `web workers` are in HTML5 and their role in improving performance.
   - **Answer:** `Web workers` in HTML5 allow JavaScript to run in the background, separate from the main execution thread of the web page. This helps in performing resource-intensive tasks, such as calculations or data processing, without blocking the user interface. Web workers enable better performance and a more responsive user experience. Example:
     ```javascript
     const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
     worker.postMessage('Hello Worker');
     worker.onmessage = function(e) {
       console.log('Worker said: ', e.data);
     };
     ```
     This code creates a new web worker that runs in a separate thread, allowing the main page to remain responsive.

#### 96. **What is the `data-*` attribute in HTML5, and how is it useful?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `data-*` attribute in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `data-*` attribute in HTML5 allows developers to store custom data on HTML elements. These attributes can be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript, enabling developers to store extra information without using non-standard attributes. Example:
     ```html
     <div data-user-id="12345" data-role="admin">User Info</div>
     ```
     JavaScript can then access these attributes:
     ```javascript
     const userId = document.querySelector('div').dataset.userId;
     const role = document.querySelector('div').dataset.role;
     ```
     The `data-*` attributes are particularly useful for storing temporary data or passing information between HTML and JavaScript.

#### 97. **What is the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5, and how does it enhance form usability?**
   - **Question:** Discuss the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 input elements and its benefits.
   - **Answer:** The `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 provides a short hint or description of the expected input in a form field. This text is displayed inside the input field when it is empty, and disappears when the user starts typing. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
     ```
     The `placeholder` attribute enhances form usability by guiding users on what to enter, reducing the likelihood of errors.

#### 98. **How does HTML5 support media elements like `audio` and `video`?**
   - **Question:** Explain how HTML5 handles media elements like `audio` and `video`.
   - **Answer:** HTML5 provides native support for embedding audio and video files directly into web pages using the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements. These elements do not require external plugins like Flash and support a variety of codecs. Example:
     ```html
     <audio controls>
       <source src="audiofile.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
       Your browser does not support the audio element.
     </audio>
     <video controls>
       <source src="videofile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
       Your browser does not support the video element.
     </video>
     ```
     These elements come with built-in controls for play, pause, volume, and more, making media integration seamless.

#### 99. **What is the `required` attribute in HTML5 forms, and how does it improve form validation?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `required` attribute in HTML5 and its impact on form validation.
   - **Answer:** The `required` attribute in HTML5 ensures that a form field must be filled out before the form can be submitted. This client-side validation reduces the likelihood of incomplete form submissions. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" required>
     ```
     If the user tries to submit the form without entering a value in this field, the browser will prompt the user to complete it.

#### 100. **What is the purpose of the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 forms.
   - **Answer:** The `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 automatically focuses a specific form input field when the page loads. This is particularly useful in forms where a particular field should be the user's first point of interaction. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" autofocus>
     ```
     The input field with the `autofocus` attribute will be ready to receive user input as soon as the page is rendered.

These additional HTML5 questions continue to delve into important features and practices, ensuring a thorough understanding of HTML5 for modern web development.
