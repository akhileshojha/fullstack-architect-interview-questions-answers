     <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
     <script>
       const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
       const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
       ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
       ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 75);
     </script>
     ```
     This code creates a red rectangle on the canvas.

#### 4. **What are Web Storage APIs in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What are the Web Storage APIs in HTML5, and how do they differ from cookies?
   - **Answer:** Web Storage APIs in HTML5 provide a way to store data locally in the user's browser. There are two types:
     - **Local Storage:** Stores data with no expiration date.
     - **Session Storage:** Stores data for the duration of the page session.
     
     Unlike cookies, Web Storage allows for storing more data (up to 5-10 MB), and the data is not sent to the server with each HTTP request. Itâ€™s a more efficient way to handle local data.

#### 5. **Explain the role of the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements in HTML5.**
   - **Question:** What are the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements in HTML5, and how do they enhance multimedia support?
   - **Answer:** The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements in HTML5 allow developers to embed video and audio files directly into web pages without needing third-party plugins like Flash. They provide native support for controls (play, pause, volume), and developers can manipulate these elements using JavaScript. Example:
     ```html
     <video width="320" height="240" controls>
       <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
       Your browser does not support the video tag.
     </video>

     <audio controls>
       <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
       Your browser does not support the audio element.
     </audio>
     ```

#### 6. **What is the difference between `<article>` and `<section>` in HTML5?**

   - **Answer:** 
     - **`<article>`:** Represents a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.
     - **`<section>`:** Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. It is used to group related content together within a document.
     
     The main difference is that `<article>` is for content that makes sense on its own, while `<section>` is for organizing content within a page or document.

#### 7. **How does the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` element pair work in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What is the purpose of the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements in HTML5?
   - **Answer:** The `<figure>` element is used to group media content like images, diagrams, or code snippets, along with a caption provided by the `<figcaption>` element. The caption is typically placed within the `<figure>` tag. This helps provide context to the media content and makes it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to interpret.
     ```html
     <figure>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="A scenic view">
       <figcaption>A beautiful scenic view</figcaption>
     </figure>
     ```

#### 8. **What is the purpose of the `data-*` attributes in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What are `data-*` attributes in HTML5, and how are they used?
   - **Answer:** The `data-*` attributes in HTML5 are custom data attributes that allow developers to store extra information on HTML elements. These attributes are useful for embedding custom data in an element, which can then be accessed via JavaScript. Example:
     ```html
     <div id="user" data-id="12345" data-role="admin">John Doe</div>
     <script>
       const userDiv = document.getElementById('user');
       console.log(userDiv.dataset.id);  // Outputs: 12345
       console.log(userDiv.dataset.role); // Outputs: admin
     </script>
     ```

#### 9. **What is the purpose of the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 forms?**
   - **Question:** What is the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used in form elements?
   - **Answer:** The `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 is used to provide a hint or example text inside a form input element, guiding the user on what to enter. The text disappears when the user starts typing. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
     ```
     This input field will display "Enter your name" until the user begins to type.

#### 10. **How does HTML5 support offline web applications?**
   - **Question:** Explain how HTML5 enables offline web applications.
   - **Answer:** HTML5 provides support for offline web applications through the Application Cache (AppCache) and the newer Service Workers. 
     - **AppCache:** Allows developers to specify resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images) that the browser should cache, so the application can load and function without an internet connection.
     - **Service Workers:** A more powerful and flexible way to handle offline functionality, service workers act as a proxy between the web application and the network, allowing for advanced caching strategies, background sync, and push notifications.

These questions cover fundamental aspects of HTML5, offering a strong foundation for any interview focusing on modern web development.

   - **Answer:** The `required` attribute in HTML5 is used to indicate that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form. If the user tries to submit the form without filling out the required fields, the browser will automatically display a validation message. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="username" required>
     ```
     This field must be filled out before the form can be submitted.

#### 13. **How do you create a responsive web design using HTML5?**
   - **Question:** How can HTML5 be used to create a responsive web design?
   - **Answer:** Responsive web design can be achieved using HTML5 along with CSS3. Key techniques include:
     - **Viewport Meta Tag:** Ensures the layout adjusts to the device's screen size.
       ```html
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       ```
     - **Media Queries:** CSS3 media queries allow different styles to be applied based on screen size, orientation, and resolution.
     - **Fluid Grid Layouts:** Use percentage-based widths rather than fixed pixel values to allow the layout to resize fluidly.
     - **Flexible Images and Media:** Images and other media should scale with the grid using CSS properties like `max-width: 100%`.

#### 14. **What is the difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Compare `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** Both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are part of the Web Storage API in HTML5, used for storing data on the client side.
     - **`localStorage`:** Stores data with no expiration time, meaning the data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. It is useful for storing long-term data.
     - **`sessionStorage`:** Stores data that is only available during the page session. The data is deleted once the page session ends, such as when the browser tab is closed. It is suitable for temporary data that doesn't need to persist.

#### 15. **Explain the `progress` element in HTML5.**
   - **Question:** What is the purpose of the `progress` element in HTML5?
   - **Answer:** The `progress` element in HTML5 represents the completion progress of a task, such as downloading a file or loading a page. It provides a visual indicator of the progress and can be used with JavaScript to dynamically update the value. Example:
     ```html
     <progress value="70" max="100">70%</progress>
     ```
     This code displays a progress bar that is 70% complete.

#### 16. **What are HTML5 data attributes, and how do you use them?**
   - **Question:** What are `data-*` attributes in HTML5, and how are they utilized?
   - **Answer:** HTML5 `data-*` attributes allow developers to embed custom data within HTML elements. These attributes start with `data-` followed by a custom name, and they can store information that can be accessed via JavaScript. Example:
     ```html
     <div data-user-id="12345" data-role="admin">John Doe</div>
     <script>
       const user = document.querySelector('div');
       console.log(user.dataset.userId); // Outputs: 12345
       console.log(user.dataset.role);   // Outputs: admin
     </script>
     ```
     `data-*` attributes are commonly used for storing metadata that doesn't need to be displayed but is required for scripting purposes.

#### 17. **What are the new graphic elements introduced in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Name and describe the new graphic elements introduced in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** HTML5 introduces the following graphic elements:
     - **`<canvas>`:** Provides a drawing surface that allows for 2D graphics, animations, and other visual content using JavaScript.
     - **`<svg>` (Scalable Vector Graphics):** A language for describing 2D graphics in XML. It is used for rendering vector-based graphics directly in the browser.
     
     Both `<canvas>` and `<svg>` are used for rendering graphics, but they serve different purposes. `<canvas>` is bitmap-based and suited for dynamic content, while `<svg>` is vector-based and better for static or interactive graphics that need to scale.

#### 18. **How does the `placeholder` attribute enhance form usability in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What is the `placeholder` attribute, and how does it enhance form usability in HTML5?
   - **Answer:** The `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 is used to provide a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field. This text appears inside the input field until the user starts typing, offering guidance on what to enter. It improves form usability by providing context without the need for separate labels or instructions. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your username">
     ```

#### 19. **What is the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 is used to automatically focus an input field or textarea when the page loads, meaning the cursor will be placed in that field without the user having to click on it. This attribute enhances user experience by directing attention to the most important or first input field. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="username" autofocus>
     ```

#### 20. **What are the advantages of using the `<nav>` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What is the `<nav>` element in HTML5, and what are its advantages?
   - **Answer:** The `<nav>` element in HTML5 is used to define a block of navigation links. It is a semantic element that helps structure the page's navigation and improves accessibility and SEO. By using `<nav>`, screen readers and search engines can easily identify and prioritize the site's navigation structure. Example:
     ```html
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
         <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
     ```

### HTML5 Interview Questions and Answers

#### 21. **What is the `datalist` element in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `datalist` element in HTML5 and its purpose.
   - **Answer:** The `datalist` element in HTML5 provides an autocomplete feature on input elements. It contains a set of `<option>` elements that represent possible values for the corresponding `<input>` element. As the user types into the input field, the browser shows a dropdown list of the available options. Example:
     ```html
     <input list="browsers" name="browser" id="browser">
     <datalist id="browsers">
       <option value="Chrome">
       <option value="Firefox">
       <option value="Safari">
       <option value="Edge">
       <option value="Opera">
     </datalist>
     ```
     This creates a text input field with a dropdown list of browsers.

#### 22. **What is the difference between `section` and `div` elements in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `section` and `div` elements in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `section` and `div` elements are both used to group content in HTML5, but they have different purposes:
     - **`<section>`:** This is a semantic element used to group related content into a section, typically with a heading. It's meant to indicate a standalone section of content that could be independently reusable.
     - **`<div>`:** This is a non-semantic element used purely for styling or scripting purposes. It doesn't carry any meaning about the content it encloses.
     
     Using `<section>` instead of `<div>` can improve accessibility and SEO by providing more context to search engines and assistive technologies.

#### 23. **What are custom elements in HTML5, and how do you create one?**
   - **Question:** What are custom elements in HTML5, and how can you create a custom element?
   - **Answer:** Custom elements in HTML5 allow developers to define their own HTML tags and behaviors, encapsulating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a reusable component. To create a custom element, you typically extend the HTMLElement class in JavaScript and define its behavior using the Custom Elements API. Example:
     ```javascript
     class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement {
       constructor() {
         super();
         this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
         this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<p>Hello, world!</p>`;
       }
     }
     customElements.define('my-custom-element', MyCustomElement);
     ```
     You can then use `<my-custom-element></my-custom-element>` in your HTML.

#### 24. **Explain the `figure` and `figcaption` elements in HTML5.**
   - **Question:** What are the `figure` and `figcaption` elements in HTML5, and how are they used?
   - **Answer:** The `figure` element is used to group media content like images, diagrams, or illustrations, along with their associated captions, provided by the `figcaption` element. The content inside a `figure` is typically referenced in the main content, but it can be moved or removed without affecting the content flow. Example:
     ```html
     <figure>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
       <figcaption>This is a sample image.</figcaption>
     </figure>
     ```
     This markup provides a semantic structure for images and their captions.

#### 25. **What is the purpose of the `mark` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `mark` element in HTML5 and its use case.
   - **Answer:** The `mark` element in HTML5 is used to highlight text that is of particular relevance or importance within a larger context, like search results or keywords in a document. The text within the `mark` tag is typically rendered with a yellow background by default. Example:
     ```html
     <p>This is an <mark>important</mark> word in the sentence.</p>
     ```
     The word "important" would be highlighted in the sentence.

#### 26. **What is the `main` element in HTML5, and why is it important?**
   - **Question:** Explain the purpose of the `main` element in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `main` element in HTML5 is used to encapsulate the primary content of a webpage, distinguishing it from content that is repeated across pages like headers, footers, or sidebars. This helps search engines and assistive technologies quickly identify the core content. Example:
     ```html
     <main>
       <h1>Main Content</h1>
       <p>This is the main area of the webpage.</p>
     </main>
     ```
     Using `<main>` improves the structure and accessibility of web pages.

#### 27. **What is the `output` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `output` element in HTML5 and when it should be used.
   - **Answer:** The `output` element in HTML5 is used to represent the result of a calculation or user action, often in forms or interactive applications. It is linked to a form control using the `for` attribute. Example:
     ```html
     <form oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
       <input type="number" id="a" value="50"> +
       <input type="number" id="b" value="100">
       <output name="result" for="a b">150</output>
     </form>
     ```
     This shows how `output` can be used to display the result of adding two numbers.

#### 28. **How does the `details` and `summary` elements work in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `details` and `summary` elements in HTML5 and how they interact.
   - **Answer:** The `details` element in HTML5 creates a collapsible content area that can be expanded or collapsed by the user. The `summary` element, which must be the first child of `details`, provides a visible heading that users can click to toggle the visibility of the content. Example:
     ```html
     <details>
       <summary>More Information</summary>
       <p>This is the content that is initially hidden and can be expanded.</p>
     </details>
     ```
     When the user clicks on "More Information," the content is revealed.

#### 29. **What are semantic elements in HTML5, and why are they important?**
   - **Question:** What are semantic elements in HTML5, and what benefits do they offer?
   - **Answer:** Semantic elements in HTML5 are HTML tags that provide meaning about the content enclosed within them, rather than just presentation. Examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`. These elements improve the readability of the code, provide better accessibility, and enhance SEO by giving search engines more context about the structure and content of the webpage.

#### 30. **What is the `template` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `template` element in HTML5 and its typical usage.
   - **Answer:** The `template` element in HTML5 is used to define HTML content that is not to be rendered when the page loads, but can be used later in the document through JavaScript. It's useful for client-side templating, where you may need to clone or insert content dynamically. Example:
     ```html
     <template id="my-template">
       <p>This is a template content.</p>
     </template>
     <script>
       let template = document.getElementById('my-template').content.cloneNode(true);
       document.body.appendChild(template);
     </script>
     ```
     This allows you to define reusable content that can be injected into the DOM at runtime.

These questions continue to cover essential aspects of HTML5, focusing on elements that enhance the structure, usability, and interactivity of modern web pages.

   - **Answer:** The `progress` element in HTML5 represents the completion progress of a task, such as a file upload or a download. It is a visual indicator of progress, with a value attribute specifying the current progress and a max attribute specifying the maximum value. Example:
     ```html
     <progress value="70" max="100">70%</progress>
     ```
     This code creates a progress bar that is 70% complete. The `progress` element is particularly useful for showing progress in forms or other tasks in a web application.

#### 32. **What is the `meter` element in HTML5, and how is it different from `progress`?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `meter` element in HTML5 and how it differs from the `progress` element.
   - **Answer:** The `meter` element in HTML5 represents a scalar measurement within a known range, such as disk usage, temperature, or a voting result. Unlike the `progress` element, which shows task completion, the `meter` is used to indicate a value within a range. Example:
     ```html
     <meter value="0.6" min="0" max="1">60%</meter>
     ```
     This creates a meter that shows 60% of the maximum value. The `meter` element is more appropriate when representing a bounded value, while `progress` is used for showing task progress.

#### 33. **What is the `nav` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `nav` element in HTML5 and when it should be used.
   - **Answer:** The `nav` element in HTML5 is a semantic element used to define a section of a page intended for navigation links, such as a site's primary menu or a list of links to other pages. Example:
     ```html
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
         <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
     ```
     This element helps to group navigational links, improving both accessibility and SEO by clearly defining the purpose of the content within the `nav` element.

#### 34. **How does the `time` element work in HTML5, and what are its benefits?**
   - **Question:** What is the `time` element in HTML5, and what are its use cases?

     ```html
     <time datetime="2024-08-17">August 17, 2024</time>
     ```
     This marks up a date, allowing search engines and other tools to recognize it as a date rather than just plain text. The `time` element enhances accessibility and provides meaningful context to the content.

#### 35. **What is the purpose of the `wbr` element in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `wbr` element in HTML5 and its usage.
   - **Answer:** The `wbr` (Word Break Opportunity) element in HTML5 specifies where in a long word or string it would be okay to break and wrap to the next line. It does not force a line break but allows the browser to break the line if necessary. Example:
     ```html
     <p>Thisisaverylongword<wbr>thatmightneedtobreak.</p>
     ```
     If the long word needs to wrap due to space constraints, the browser will break the word at the `wbr` point.

#### 36. **What is the `article` element in HTML5, and how is it different from `section`?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `article` and `section` elements in HTML5.

         <h3>Section 2</h3>
         <p>Content of section 2.</p>
       </section>
     </article>
     ```
     Use `article` for standalone content, and `section` for thematically grouped content.

#### 37. **What is the `aside` element in HTML5, and how should it be used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `aside` element in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `aside` element in HTML5 is used for content that is related to the main content but is not part of the primary narrative flow, such as sidebars, pull quotes, or related links. Example:
     ```html
     <article>
       <h2>Main Content</h2>
       <p>This is the main content of the article.</p>
       <aside>
         <p>Related link: <a href="#">Read more about this topic</a>.</p>
       </aside>
     </article>
     ```
     Content in the `aside` element is supplementary to the main content and is often positioned as a sidebar.

#### 38. **How do you include audio files in a webpage using HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain how to embed audio files in a webpage using the `audio` element in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `audio` element in HTML5 is used to embed sound content into a webpage. You can specify multiple source files with different formats to ensure compatibility across browsers. Example:
     ```html
     <audio controls>
       <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
       <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
       Your browser does not support the audio element.

     ```
     This code provides a dropdown list of browser options while still allowing users to type in other values.

#### 49. **What is the `form` attribute in HTML5, and how does it differ from previous HTML versions?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `form` attribute in HTML5 and how it differs from previous HTML forms.
   - **Answer:** The `form` attribute in HTML5 allows form controls (`input`, `button`, `select`, etc.) to be associated with a form that is not their immediate ancestor. This means form elements can be placed outside of the `form` tag but still be associated with it. Example:
     ```html
     <form id="myForm">
       <input type="text" name="username">
     </form>
     <input type="submit" form="myForm" value="Submit">
     ```
     The submit button is outside the form but still submits the data from the form with ID `myForm`.

#### 50. **How do you use the `required` attribute in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `required` attribute in HTML5 and its effect on form elements.
   - **Answer:** The `required` attribute in HTML5 is used to indicate that a form field must be filled out before submitting the form. It can be applied to `input`, `textarea`, and `select` elements. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="username" required>
     ```
     This input field must be filled out before the form can be submitted, enforcing basic form validation directly in the browser.

These questions cover a range of HTML5 features, focusing on form elements, attributes, and their roles in enhancing user experience and form functionality.

     ```
     The `output` element is useful for displaying dynamic results directly on the page.

#### 76. **What is the `autoplay` attribute in the `video` and `audio` elements in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `autoplay` attribute in the `video` and `audio` elements. How does it affect media playback?
   - **Answer:** The `autoplay` attribute in HTML5 specifies that the media (video or audio) should start playing automatically as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading. Example:
     ```html
     <video src="video.mp4" autoplay></video>
     ```
     Autoplay can enhance user experience by reducing interaction but should be used cautiously as it can be disruptive. Many browsers restrict autoplay functionality, especially when audio is present.

#### 77. **What is the `preload` attribute in the `video` and `audio` elements, and what values can it take?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `preload` attribute in HTML5 media elements and its possible values.
   - **Answer:** The `preload` attribute in HTML5 provides a hint to the browser about how much of the media file should be preloaded when the page loads. It can take the following values:
     - `none`: Do not preload any media data.
     - `metadata`: Preload only metadata (e.g., duration, dimensions).
     - `auto`: Preload the entire file (or as much as possible).
     Example:
     ```html
     <audio src="audio.mp3" preload="metadata"></audio>
     ```
     This helps manage the balance between faster playback and conserving data/bandwidth.

#### 78. **How does the `muted` attribute work in HTML5 media elements?**
   - **Question:** What is the purpose of the `muted` attribute in HTML5, and how is it typically used?
   - **Answer:** The `muted` attribute in HTML5 is used to mute the audio track of a video or audio element by default. When present, the media will start with its volume turned off. Example:
     ```html
     <video src="video.mp4" muted autoplay></video>
     ```
     This attribute is particularly useful in autoplay scenarios to avoid disrupting the user with unexpected sound.

#### 79. **What are the accessibility considerations when using HTML5 elements like `video` and `audio`?**

     - **Captions/Subtitles**: For video content, provide captions or subtitles for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.
     - **Transcripts**: Provide a text transcript of the audio or video content.
     - **Controls**: Ensure that custom controls are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
     - **Alt Text**: For media that serves as content, provide a descriptive text alternative.
     Example:
     ```html
     <video controls>
       <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
       Your browser does not support the video tag. Here is a <a href="video.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
     </video>
     ```

#### 80. **What is the `track` element in HTML5, and how is it used with media elements?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `track` element in HTML5 and how it enhances media accessibility.
   - **Answer:** The `track` element in HTML5 is used to specify text tracks for media elements like `video` and `audio`. It can provide captions, subtitles, or descriptions, enhancing accessibility. The `track` element has several attributes like `kind`, `src`, `srclang`, and `label`. Example:
     ```html
     <video src="video.mp4" controls>
       <track src="subtitles_en.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
       <track src="subtitles_es.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="es" label="Spanish">
     </video>
     ```
     This allows users to choose subtitles in different languages, making the media more accessible.

     ```html
     <html manifest="app.appcache">
     ```
     The manifest file typically includes sections for caching resources, fallback mechanisms, and resources that should never be cached. This feature has been deprecated and replaced by service workers.

#### 82. **What is `localStorage` in HTML5, and how is it different from `sessionStorage`?**
   - **Question:** Compare `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** Both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are part of the Web Storage API, allowing websites to store data in the browser. The key differences are:
     - `localStorage`: Stores data with no expiration time, meaning the data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
     - `sessionStorage`: Stores data only for the duration of the page session; the data is cleared when the page session ends (i.e., when the browser tab is closed).
     Example:
     ```javascript
     localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
     sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
     ```

#### 83. **What is the `async` attribute in the `script` tag in HTML5, and how does it work?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `async` attribute in the HTML5 `script` tag and its effect on script loading.
   - **Answer:** The `async` attribute in the HTML5 `script` tag is used to load external JavaScript files asynchronously. When this attribute is present, the script will be fetched and executed as soon as it's available, without blocking the parsing of the rest of the page. Example:
     ```html
     <script src="script.js" async></script>
     ```
     The `async` attribute is particularly useful for loading scripts that don't depend on the DOM or other scripts, like analytics or tracking scripts.

#### 84. **What is the `defer` attribute in the `script` tag in HTML5, and how does it differ from `async`?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `defer` attribute in the HTML5 `script` tag and how it differs from `async`.
   - **Answer:** The `defer` attribute in the `script` tag ensures that the script is executed only after the HTML document has been fully parsed. Unlike `async`, which executes as soon as the script is available, `defer` scripts maintain their order relative to each other and execute after the document is ready. Example:
     ```html
     <script src="script.js" defer></script>
     ```
     This is ideal for scripts that need the DOM to be fully built before execution.

#### 85. **What is the purpose of the `datalist` element in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `datalist` element in HTML5 and its functionality.
   - **Answer:** The `datalist` element in HTML5 provides an autocomplete feature for form input elements. It contains a set of `option` elements that define the possible values for an associated `input` element. Example:
     ```html
     <input list="browsers" name="browser">
     <datalist id="browsers">
       <option value="Chrome">
       <option value="Firefox">
       <option value="Safari">
       <option value="Edge">
     </datalist>
     ```
     When the user starts typing in the input field, the browser suggests options from the `datalist`.

#### 86. **What are the `required` and `pattern` attributes in HTML5 forms, and how do they improve form validation?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `required` and `pattern` attributes in HTML5 and their role in form validation.
   - **Answer:** The `required` attribute in HTML5 makes an input field mandatory, preventing form submission unless the field is filled. The `pattern` attribute allows you to specify a regular expression that the input value must match. Together, these attributes enhance client-side form validation. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" required pattern="[A-Za-z]{3,}">
     ```
     This input field is mandatory and only accepts alphabetic characters with a minimum length of three.

#### 87. **What is the `progress` element in HTML5, and how is it different from the `meter` element?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `progress` and `meter` elements in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** The `progress` element in HTML5 represents the completion progress of a task, often used to show the progress of a file upload or a form submission. It is linear and reflects progress towards completion. The `meter` element, in contrast, represents a scalar measurement within a known range, such as a battery level or rating. Example:
     ```html
     <progress value="50" max="100"></progress>
     <meter value="0.6" min="0" max="1"></meter>
     ```
     `progress` is for tasks, while `meter` is for measurements.

#### 88. **What is the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5, and what is its purpose in form inputs?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 input elements.
   - **Answer:** The `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 provides a hint to the user about what to enter in the input field. It displays text inside the input field when it is empty, but it disappears once the user starts typing. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
     ```
     The `placeholder` attribute improves the user experience by providing contextual information directly within the input field.

#### 89. **What is the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used in forms?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 is used to automatically focus an input field when the page loads, saving the user from manually clicking into the field. Only one input field in a form can have the `autofocus` attribute. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" autofocus>
     ```
     This attribute is useful in forms where a specific field should be the first point of user interaction.

#### 90. **What is the `novalidate` attribute in HTML5 forms, and when would you use it?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `novalidate` attribute in HTML5 forms and its use case.
   - **Answer:** The `novalidate` attribute in HTML5 is used to disable the browser's built-in form validation when submitting a form. This attribute is useful when you want to handle form validation entirely through JavaScript or a server-side script. Example:
     ```html
     <form novalidate>
       <input type="email" required>
       <input type="submit">
     </form>
     ```
     With `novalidate`, the form can be submitted even if the email input is invalid according to the browser's rules.

     ```html
     <form oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
       <input type="range" id="a" value="50"> +
       <input type="number" id="b" value="50">
       <output name="result" for="a b">100</output>
     </form>
     ```
     Here, the `output` element shows the sum of the values of the two inputs.

#### 92. **What are the differences between HTML4 and HTML5 in terms of document structure and semantic elements?**
   - **Question:** Compare the document structure and semantic elements of HTML4 with those of HTML5.
   - **Answer:** HTML5 introduces several new structural and semantic elements that were not present in HTML4. In HTML4, developers often used generic `div` and `span` tags to structure content, leading to less semantic markup. HTML5 introduces new semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` to improve the clarity and meaning of the document structure. These elements help both developers and search engines better understand the content's purpose.
     Example in HTML4:
     ```html
     <div class="header"></div>
     <div class="content"></div>
     <div class="footer"></div>
     ```
     Equivalent in HTML5:
     ```html
     <header></header>
     <main></main>
     <footer></footer>
     ```

#### 93. **How does the `progress` element work in HTML5, and what attributes does it support?**

   - **Answer:** The `progress` element in HTML5 is used to represent the completion progress of a task, such as a file download or upload. It displays a progress bar that can be updated dynamically via JavaScript. The key attributes are `value` (current progress) and `max` (total value). Example:
     ```html
     <progress value="30" max="100"></progress>
     ```
     This creates a progress bar that is 30% complete. If the `max` attribute is omitted, it defaults to 1.

#### 94. **What is the `meter` element in HTML5, and when would you use it?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `meter` element in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `meter` element in HTML5 is used to represent a scalar measurement within a known range, such as a disk usage indicator or a rating. Unlike the `progress` element, which indicates progress toward completion, the `meter` element shows how a value compares to a range of possible values. Example:
     ```html
     <meter value="0.6" min="0" max="1" low="0.3" high="0.8" optimum="0.5"></meter>
     ```
     This creates a meter indicating a value of 0.6, with additional attributes to highlight what ranges are considered low, high, or optimum.

#### 95. **What are `web workers` in HTML5, and how do they help with performance?**
   - **Question:** Explain what `web workers` are in HTML5 and their role in improving performance.
   - **Answer:** `Web workers` in HTML5 allow JavaScript to run in the background, separate from the main execution thread of the web page. This helps in performing resource-intensive tasks, such as calculations or data processing, without blocking the user interface. Web workers enable better performance and a more responsive user experience. Example:
     ```javascript
     const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
     worker.postMessage('Hello Worker');
     worker.onmessage = function(e) {
       console.log('Worker said: ', e.data);
     };
     ```
     This code creates a new web worker that runs in a separate thread, allowing the main page to remain responsive.

#### 96. **What is the `data-*` attribute in HTML5, and how is it useful?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `data-*` attribute in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `data-*` attribute in HTML5 allows developers to store custom data on HTML elements. These attributes can be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript, enabling developers to store extra information without using non-standard attributes. Example:
     ```html
     <div data-user-id="12345" data-role="admin">User Info</div>
     ```
     JavaScript can then access these attributes:
     ```javascript
     const userId = document.querySelector('div').dataset.userId;
     const role = document.querySelector('div').dataset.role;
     ```
     The `data-*` attributes are particularly useful for storing temporary data or passing information between HTML and JavaScript.

#### 97. **What is the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5, and how does it enhance form usability?**
   - **Question:** Discuss the `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 input elements and its benefits.
   - **Answer:** The `placeholder` attribute in HTML5 provides a short hint or description of the expected input in a form field. This text is displayed inside the input field when it is empty, and disappears when the user starts typing. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
     ```
     The `placeholder` attribute enhances form usability by guiding users on what to enter, reducing the likelihood of errors.

#### 98. **How does HTML5 support media elements like `audio` and `video`?**
   - **Question:** Explain how HTML5 handles media elements like `audio` and `video`.
   - **Answer:** HTML5 provides native support for embedding audio and video files directly into web pages using the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements. These elements do not require external plugins like Flash and support a variety of codecs. Example:
     ```html
     <audio controls>
       <source src="audiofile.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
       Your browser does not support the audio element.
     </audio>
     <video controls>
       <source src="videofile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
       Your browser does not support the video element.
     </video>
     ```
     These elements come with built-in controls for play, pause, volume, and more, making media integration seamless.

   - **Answer:** The `srcset` attribute in the `<img>` tag is used to define multiple image sources for different screen sizes or resolutions. It allows the browser to choose the most appropriate image to load based on the device's screen size, resolution, or network conditions, thereby improving responsiveness and performance. Example:
     ```html
     <img src="small.jpg" 
          srcset="small.jpg 480w, medium.jpg 800w, large.jpg 1200w" 
          sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px" 
          alt="Example Image">
     ```
     In this example, the browser selects the most suitable image from the `srcset` based on the screen size and displays it, ensuring optimal performance and visual quality.

#### 102. **How does the `picture` element differ from the `srcset` attribute?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `picture` element and the `srcset` attribute in HTML5. When would you use each?
   - **Answer:** The `picture` element provides more control over which image to display based on different conditions like media queries, whereas `srcset` is mainly used for selecting different image resolutions. The `picture` element is ideal when you want to serve completely different images depending on factors like device orientation or specific breakpoints. Example:
     ```html
     <picture>
       <source media="(max-width: 600px)" srcset="small.jpg">
       <source media="(max-width: 1200px)" srcset="medium.jpg">
       <img src="large.jpg" alt="Example Image">
     </picture>
     ```
     Here, the `picture` element allows specifying different images for different screen sizes.

#### 103. **What is the `preload` attribute in the `<link>` tag, and how does it affect page load performance?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `preload` attribute in the `<link>` tag and its impact on web page performance.
   - **Answer:** The `preload` attribute is used in the `<link>` tag to instruct the browser to load a resource (like a stylesheet, script, or font) as soon as possible, even before itâ€™s needed by the page. This can significantly improve page load performance, especially for critical resources. Example:
     ```html
     <link rel="preload" href="styles.css" as="style">
     ```
     By preloading the stylesheet, the browser can apply it more quickly when the content that relies on it is rendered.

#### 104. **What are Microdata in HTML5, and how do they relate to structured data?**
   - **Question:** Explain what Microdata are in HTML5 and their purpose in enhancing structured data.
   - **Answer:** Microdata is a set of HTML5 attributes that helps to embed structured data within web pages, making it easier for search engines and other automated systems to understand the content. Microdata is often used with schemas defined by Schema.org to mark up elements like products, reviews, and events. Example:
     ```html
     <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
       <span itemprop="name">John Doe</span>
       <span itemprop="jobTitle">Software Engineer</span>
       <span itemprop="email">johndoe@example.com</span>
     </div>
     ```
     Here, Microdata provides structured information about a person, which search engines can use to enhance search results.

#### 105. **What is the `async` attribute in HTML5, and how does it affect script loading?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `async` attribute in the `<script>` tag and its role in script loading.
   - **Answer:** The `async` attribute in the `<script>` tag tells the browser to download the script in the background without blocking the page rendering process. Once the script is downloaded, it is executed immediately, which can improve page loading speed, especially for non-critical scripts. Example:
     ```html
     <script src="script.js" async></script>
     ```
     This script will be fetched asynchronously, allowing the page to continue loading while the script is being downloaded.

#### 106. **What is the `defer` attribute in the `<script>` tag, and how is it different from `async`?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `defer` and `async` attributes in the `<script>` tag in terms of script loading behavior.
   - **Answer:** The `defer` attribute also allows the browser to download the script in the background, but unlike `async`, the script is not executed until the HTML document has been fully parsed. This ensures that scripts are executed in order and after the document is ready. Example:
     ```html
     <script src="script.js" defer></script>
     ```
     The script with `defer` will execute only after the document has been completely loaded, which is beneficial for scripts that depend on the full document being available.

#### 107. **What is the difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the differences between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** Both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are part of the Web Storage API in HTML5, used to store data on the client side. The key difference is in their persistence:
     - `localStorage`: Data stored in `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. It is scoped to the entire origin.
     - `sessionStorage`: Data stored in `sessionStorage` is only available for the duration of the page session (i.e., as long as the browser tab is open). It is scoped to the specific tab and is cleared when the tab is closed.
     Example:
     ```javascript
     localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
     sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
     ```

#### 108. **How does the `<template>` element work in HTML5, and what are its typical use cases?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `<template>` element in HTML5 and its use cases.
   - **Answer:** The `<template>` element in HTML5 is used to declare HTML that is not rendered immediately when the page loads. This content remains inactive until it is activated via JavaScript, making it useful for reusable content like fragments, components, or dynamic insertion of content. Example:
     ```html
     <template id="my-template">
       <div class="template-content">This is a template!</div>
     </template>
     <script>
       const template = document.getElementById('my-template');
       document.body.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
     </script>
     ```
     The content inside the `<template>` element is rendered only when it is explicitly added to the DOM using JavaScript.

#### 109. **What are the benefits of using the `contenteditable` attribute in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `contenteditable` attribute in HTML5 and its advantages.
   - **Answer:** The `contenteditable` attribute in HTML5 allows any HTML element to be editable by the user, turning it into an interactive, editable field. This is particularly useful for implementing rich text editors or inline editing features without requiring additional JavaScript libraries. Example:
     ```html
     <div contenteditable="true">This text is editable!</div>
     ```
     When a user clicks on this div, they can edit its content directly in the browser.

#### 110. **What is the `datalist` element in HTML5, and how does it enhance input fields?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `datalist` element in HTML5 and its typical use case.
   - **Answer:** The `datalist` element in HTML5 provides a list of predefined options for an input field, enhancing user experience by offering suggestions while typing. This is often used for autocomplete features. Example:
     ```html
     <input list="browsers" name="browser">
     <datalist id="browsers">
       <option value="Chrome">
       <option value="Firefox">
       <option value="Safari">
       <option value="Edge">
     </datalist>
     ```
     As the user types in the input field, they will see a dropdown list of the available options, making it easier to select a valid entry.

### HTML5 Interview Questions and Answers

#### 111. **What is the purpose of the `hidden` attribute in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `hidden` attribute in HTML5 and how it differs from using CSS `display: none;`.
   - **Answer:** The `hidden` attribute in HTML5 is used to hide elements from the page without deleting them from the DOM. Unlike `display: none;` in CSS, which is purely for presentation, the `hidden` attribute is a semantic way to indicate that the element is not relevant or should not be displayed. The element can be made visible by removing the `hidden` attribute via JavaScript. Example:
     ```html
     <div hidden>This content is hidden.</div>
     ```
     The `hidden` attribute is useful for toggling visibility of elements in a manner that is accessible and easily controlled via JavaScript.

#### 112. **How do `audio` and `video` tags work in HTML5, and what are their common attributes?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `audio` and `video` tags in HTML5. What are some common attributes associated with these tags?
   - **Answer:** The `audio` and `video` tags in HTML5 are used to embed media files (sound and video) directly into web pages. They eliminate the need for third-party plugins like Flash. Common attributes include:
     - `src`: Specifies the path to the media file.
     - `controls`: Adds play, pause, and other controls to the media.
     - `autoplay`: Starts playing the media as soon as it is ready.

#### 113. **What is the `srcdoc` attribute in the `<iframe>` tag, and how does it differ from `src`?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `srcdoc` attribute in the `<iframe>` tag and its difference from the `src` attribute.
   - **Answer:** The `srcdoc` attribute in the `<iframe>` tag allows you to define the content of the iframe directly as HTML code, rather than loading it from an external URL as with the `src` attribute. This can be useful for embedding small amounts of HTML content without creating a separate HTML file. Example:
     ```html
     <iframe srcdoc="<p>This is embedded HTML content.</p>"></iframe>
     ```
     While `src` loads content from a URL, `srcdoc` directly includes the HTML code within the tag itself.

#### 114. **How can you create a responsive layout using the `viewport` meta tag in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** What role does the `viewport` meta tag play in creating responsive layouts?
   - **Answer:** The `viewport` meta tag controls how the content is displayed on different screen sizes, particularly on mobile devices. It allows developers to set the width of the viewport and scale it according to the deviceâ€™s screen size. A typical setting is:
     ```html
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     ```
     This setting ensures that the width of the page matches the screenâ€™s width and that the initial zoom level is set to 100%. It is essential for creating responsive designs that look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### 115. **What is the `accesskey` attribute, and how can it be used to improve accessibility?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `accesskey` attribute in HTML5 and its role in enhancing web accessibility.

     ```html
     <button accesskey="s">Submit</button>
     ```
     In this example, pressing the `Alt` (or `Ctrl` + `Alt` on some systems) key along with `S` will focus on and activate the button, providing a faster way to interact with the page.

#### 116. **What is the `autofocus` attribute, and when would you use it?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `autofocus` attribute in HTML5 and provide a scenario where it is useful.
   - **Answer:** The `autofocus` attribute automatically sets focus on a specific form element (like an input field) when the page loads. This is particularly useful in forms where you want to streamline user interaction by directing their attention immediately to a specific field. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="username" autofocus>
     ```
     Here, the username field will be automatically focused when the page loads, making it easier for the user to start typing immediately.

#### 117. **What is the purpose of the `formnovalidate` attribute in HTML5 forms?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `formnovalidate` attribute and how it is used in form submission.
   - **Answer:** The `formnovalidate` attribute is used on a `<button>` or `<input type="submit">` element to bypass form validation when the form is submitted. This is useful when you want to provide an option to submit a form without enforcing validation rules. Example:
     ```html
     <form>
       <input type="text" required>
       <button type="submit" formnovalidate>Submit without Validation</button>
     </form>
     ```
     In this example, the form can be submitted without meeting the validation requirements specified for the input fields.

#### 118. **How does the `spellcheck` attribute work, and in which scenarios is it particularly useful?**
   - **Question:** What is the `spellcheck` attribute, and how can it be beneficial in HTML5 forms?
   - **Answer:** The `spellcheck` attribute enables or disables spell checking for text fields in HTML5. It can be particularly useful in forms where the content is expected to be text-heavy, such as comment sections, feedback forms, or text editors. Example:
     ```html
     <textarea spellcheck="true"></textarea>
     ```
     When `spellcheck` is set to `true`, the browser will underline misspelled words, helping users correct their input before submission.

#### 119. **What is the `inputmode` attribute in HTML5, and how does it enhance form input?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `inputmode` attribute in HTML5 and its impact on mobile user experience.

     ```html
     <input type="text" inputmode="numeric">
     ```
     Here, setting `inputmode` to `numeric` will prompt a numeric keyboard on mobile devices, making it easier for users to enter numbers.

#### 120. **How do you use the `pattern` attribute for input validation in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `pattern` attribute and its role in input validation.
   - **Answer:** The `pattern` attribute in HTML5 is used to specify a regular expression that the input fieldâ€™s value must match in order for the form to be submitted. This is useful for enforcing specific formats like email addresses, phone numbers, or custom validation patterns. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" pattern="[A-Za-z]{3,}" title="Three or more letters">
     ```
     This input field will only accept values that consist of three or more letters, and will display a validation message if the pattern is not matched.

These additional HTML5 questions cover more nuanced and advanced topics, giving you a comprehensive understanding of HTML5's features and their practical applications in web development.


### HTML5 Interview Questions and Answers

#### 121. **What is the `required` attribute in HTML5, and how does it affect form elements?**

   - **Answer:** The `required` attribute in HTML5 is used to ensure that a form field is not left empty before submission. When a form with a `required` field is submitted without that field being filled, the browser will prevent the form from being submitted and typically display a validation message indicating that the field is required. This attribute is a simple yet effective way to enforce client-side validation. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="username" required>
     ```
     This input field must be filled out before the form can be submitted.

#### 122. **What is the `data-*` attribute in HTML5, and how can it be used?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `data-*` attribute in HTML5. How can developers use it in their web applications?
   - **Answer:** The `data-*` attribute is a way to store custom data private to the page or application. It allows developers to embed custom data attributes on HTML elements, which can then be accessed using JavaScript. The `*` can be replaced with any name, which serves as the key for the data. Example:
     ```html
     <div data-user-id="12345">User Content</div>
     ```
     You can access this data using JavaScript:
     ```javascript
     var userId = document.querySelector('div').dataset.userId;
     ```
     The `data-*` attributes are useful for passing data to JavaScript without polluting the global namespace.

#### 123. **How do you use the `progress` and `meter` elements in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Explain the difference between the `progress` and `meter` elements in HTML5 and provide examples of how they are used.
   - **Answer:** The `progress` element is used to represent the completion progress of a task, such as a download or upload. The `meter` element, on the other hand, is used to display a scalar measurement within a known range, such as a temperature gauge or a battery level indicator.
     - **Progress Example:**
       ```html
       <progress value="70" max="100"></progress>
       ```
       This shows a progress bar that is 70% complete.
     - **Meter Example:**
       ```html
       <meter value="0.7" min="0" max="1"></meter>
       ```
       This displays a meter indicating a value of 0.7 within a range of 0 to 1.

#### 124. **What are Web Workers in HTML5, and why are they used?**
   - **Question:** Define Web Workers in HTML5. What problem do they solve in web development?

They are used to perform computationally expensive tasks, like processing large data sets, without blocking the user interface. This helps keep the UI responsive while heavy operations are being processed. Example:
     ```javascript
     var worker = new Worker('worker.js');
     worker.onmessage = function(e) {
       console.log('Message from worker:', e.data);
     };
     worker.postMessage('Start processing');
     ```
     Web Workers solve the problem of freezing or slowing down the UI by offloading intensive tasks to a separate thread.

#### 125. **What is the `contenteditable` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `contenteditable` attribute in HTML5. Provide an example of its usage.
   - **Answer:** The `contenteditable` attribute in HTML5 makes an element editable by the user. When an element is set to `contenteditable="true"`, the user can edit the content of that element directly in the browser. This is often used in web applications where users need to modify text or HTML content directly. Example:
     ```html
     <div contenteditable="true">Edit this text.</div>
     ```
     The user can click on the text and edit it as if it were a text input field.

#### 126. **How does the `download` attribute in the `<a>` tag work in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `download` attribute in HTML5 and its purpose in the `<a>` tag.
   - **Answer:** The `download` attribute in the `<a>` tag specifies that the target file should be downloaded when the user clicks on the hyperlink, instead of navigating to the file. You can optionally specify the name for the downloaded file. Example:
     ```html
     <a href="example.pdf" download="myfile.pdf">Download PDF</a>
     ```
     When the link is clicked, the browser will download the file as `myfile.pdf` instead of opening it.

#### 127. **What is the `autocapitalize` attribute in HTML5, and how is it used?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `autocapitalize` attribute in HTML5 and its possible values.
   - **Answer:** The `autocapitalize` attribute is used in form inputs and text areas to control the capitalization of text. This attribute can be particularly useful in mobile contexts where automatic capitalization can influence user input. Possible values include:
     - `none`: No automatic capitalization.
     - `sentences`: Capitalizes the first letter of each sentence.
     - `words`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word.
     - `characters`: Capitalizes all characters.
     Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" autocapitalize="words">
     ```
     This input field will automatically capitalize the first letter of each word as the user types.

#### 128. **What is the `sandbox` attribute in the `<iframe>` tag, and what are its benefits?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `sandbox` attribute in the `<iframe>` tag. What security benefits does it provide?
   - **Answer:** The `sandbox` attribute in the `<iframe>` tag is used to apply restrictions on the content inside the iframe, enhancing security. By default, the iframe content is isolated, preventing scripts from executing or forms from being submitted. The attribute can be customized with various values to allow or restrict specific actions:
     - `allow-same-origin`: Allows content to be treated as being from the same origin.
     - `allow-scripts`: Allows scripts to run.
     - `allow-forms`: Allows forms to be submitted.
     Example:
     ```html
     <iframe src="example.html" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
     ```
     Using the `sandbox` attribute helps protect against malicious content embedded in iframes.

#### 129. **How does the `manifest` attribute work in HTML5, and what is its purpose?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `manifest` attribute in HTML5 and its role in web applications.
   - **Answer:** The `manifest` attribute in HTML5 is used to specify a URL for a cache manifest file. This file lists resources that should be cached by the browser for offline use. When the web application is accessed, these resources are downloaded and cached according to the manifest, enabling offline access to the application. Example:
     ```html
     <html manifest="app.manifest">
     ```
     The manifest file (`app.manifest`) might look like this:
     ```
     CACHE MANIFEST
     /css/styles.css
     /js/scripts.js
     /images/logo.png
     ```
     The `manifest` attribute is essential for building offline web applications.

#### 130. **What are the different states of a `<button>` element, and how do they affect user interaction?**
   - **Question:** Discuss the different states a `<button>` element can have in HTML5.
   - **Answer:** A `<button>` element in HTML5 can have several states that affect how users interact with it:
     - **Enabled:** The button is active and can be clicked by the user.
     - **Disabled:** The button is inactive and cannot be clicked, often styled with a grayed-out appearance. This state is controlled by the `disabled` attribute.
     - **Pressed (active):** The button is being clicked, providing visual feedback that the button is pressed down.
     Example:
     ```html
     <button disabled>Cannot Click</button>
     ```
     These states are important for managing user interactions and guiding users through the interface.

These additional HTML5 questions cover advanced aspects of HTML5 elements, attributes, and their application in modern web development, providing a deep understanding of the capabilities HTML5 offers.

Autocomplete allows the browser to automatically fill in values for fields based on the user's previous entries. This improves user experience by reducing the time it takes to fill out forms. The attribute can be set to `on` or `off`. Example:
     ```html
     <form autocomplete="on">
       <input type="text" name="name" autocomplete="name">
     </form>
     ```
     This form allows the browser to autocomplete the user's name based on prior entries.

#### 134. **How does the `form` attribute work in HTML5, and what problem does it solve?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `form` attribute in HTML5 and its usage. What problem does it address in form management?
   - **Answer:** The `form` attribute in HTML5 allows form controls to be associated with a form element even if they are not nested within it. This solves the problem of needing to place form elements inside a form tag, providing more flexibility in page layout and structure. Example:
     ```html
     <form id="myForm" action="/submit">
       <input type="text" name="username">
     </form>
     <input type="submit" form="myForm" value="Submit">
     ```
     The `form` attribute links the submit button to the form with `id="myForm"`.

#### 135. **What is the `novalidate` attribute in HTML5 forms, and when would you use it?**
   - **Question:** Explain the `novalidate` attribute in HTML5 forms. What is its purpose and when might it be used?
   - **Answer:** The `novalidate` attribute is used in HTML5 forms to disable the browser's automatic form validation. When applied, it prevents the browser from checking the form's fields for validation constraints like `required`, `pattern`, or `type`. This can be useful when you want to handle validation entirely with custom JavaScript. Example:
     ```html
     <form novalidate>
       <input type="email" required>
       <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </form>
     ```
     This form won't trigger HTML5 validation when submitted, allowing for custom validation logic.

#### 136. **What is the `formaction` attribute in HTML5, and how does it differ from the `action` attribute?**
   - **Question:** Describe the `formaction` attribute in HTML5. How does it differ from the `action` attribute, and when would you use it?
   - **Answer:** The `formaction` attribute in HTML5 is used on `<button>` or `<input type="submit">` elements to specify a URL where the form data should be submitted when that button is clicked. It overrides the `action` attribute of the `<form>` element for that specific button, allowing different submit buttons to send the form data to different URLs. Example:
     ```html
     <form action="/default-action">
       <input type="text" name="username">
       <button type="submit" formaction="/custom-action">Submit to Custom URL</button>
     </form>
     ```
     The form will submit to `/custom-action` when the specific button is clicked.

#### 137. **What is the `inputmode` attribute in HTML5, and how does it enhance user input?**

This attribute is useful when you want to ensure correct spelling and grammar in certain input fields (e.g., comment sections) or disable it where it might be unnecessary (e.g., code inputs). Example:
     ```html
     <textarea spellcheck="true"></textarea>
     ```
     This text area will have spell checking enabled.

#### 140. **How does the `oninput` event differ from the `onchange` event in HTML5?**
   - **Question:** Compare the `oninput` and `onchange` events in HTML5. When would you use each?
   - **Answer:** The `oninput` event in HTML5 triggers every time the value of an input or textarea changes, whereas the `onchange` event only triggers when the input loses focus after the value has been modified. The `oninput` event is ideal for real-time feedback, such as live search suggestions, while `onchange` is better for actions that should only occur after the user has finished editing. Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" oninput="console.log(this.value)">
     <input type="text" onchange="console.log(this.value)">
     ```
     The first input logs the value on every keystroke, while the second logs it only when focus is lost.

These questions continue to delve deeper into the advanced features of HTML5, exploring attributes, events, and elements that provide significant flexibility and control over web development tasks.

### HTML5 Interview Questions and Answers

   - **Question:** Describe the `preload` attribute in the `<video>` element in HTML5. What options are available, and how do they affect video loading?
   - **Answer:** The `preload` attribute in the `<video>` element controls whether and how the video should be preloaded when the page loads. It has three possible values:
     - `none`: The video is not preloaded.
     - `metadata`: Only metadata (e.g., video length, dimensions) is preloaded.
     - `auto`: The entire video file is preloaded.
     Example:
     ```html
     <video src="movie.mp4" preload="auto" controls></video>
     ```
     This video will be fully preloaded when the page loads, ensuring quicker playback.
