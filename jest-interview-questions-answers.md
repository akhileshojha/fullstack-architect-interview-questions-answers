Here are some Jest interview questions and answers, starting from number 1:

### 1. **What is Jest, and why is it used?**
   **Answer:** Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook, primarily used for testing React applications but can be used with any JavaScript codebase. It provides a powerful, easy-to-use interface for writing and running tests, with features like snapshot testing, parallel test execution, and built-in mocking capabilities.

### 2. **How do you install and set up Jest in a JavaScript project?**
   **Answer:** To install Jest, you can use npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn add --dev jest
   ```
   Then, you can add a test script to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "jest"
   }
   ```
   Now, you can run tests using the command:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### 3. **What are the key features of Jest?**
   **Answer:** Some of the key features of Jest include:
   - **Zero Configuration:** Jest works out of the box for most JavaScript projects without requiring configuration.
   - **Snapshot Testing:** Allows you to take a snapshot of your UI and compare it to previous versions.
   - **Mocks and Spies:** Jest provides built-in support for creating mocks and spies, which are useful for isolating tests.
   - **Code Coverage:** Jest can generate code coverage reports to ensure all parts of your code are tested.
   - **Parallel Test Execution:** Jest runs tests in parallel to speed up the testing process.

### 4. **What is a Jest snapshot, and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** A Jest snapshot is a way to store a serialized representation of your component’s output (often HTML) during testing. Snapshots are used to verify that a component’s output hasn’t changed unexpectedly. Here’s how you can create and use a snapshot:
   ```javascript
   test('renders correctly', () => {
     const component = renderer.create(<MyComponent />);
     let tree = component.toJSON();
     expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
   });
   ```
   When the test runs, Jest will create a snapshot file in the `__snapshots__` folder. If the component output changes, the test will fail, prompting you to update the snapshot.

### 5. **How do you mock a function in Jest?**
   **Answer:** You can mock a function in Jest using `jest.fn()` or `jest.mock()`. Here’s an example using `jest.fn()`:
   ```javascript
   const myFunction = jest.fn();

   myFunction('foo');
   expect(myFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
   expect(myFunction).toHaveBeenCalledWith('foo');
   ```
   `jest.mock()` is used to mock entire modules:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./myModule');
   const myModule = require('./myModule');

   myModule.myFunction.mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   expect(myModule.myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

### 6. **What is the difference between `beforeEach` and `beforeAll` in Jest?**
   **Answer:** 
   - `beforeEach`: Runs a setup function before each individual test in a test suite. It is useful when you need to reset state or initialize something before every test.
   - `beforeAll`: Runs a setup function once before any tests in a test suite. It is useful for setup that is shared across multiple tests and doesn’t need to be reset between tests.
   Example:
   ```javascript
   beforeEach(() => {
     // Runs before each test
   });

   beforeAll(() => {
     // Runs once before all tests
   });
   ```

### 7. **How do you test asynchronous code in Jest?**
   **Answer:** Jest provides several ways to handle asynchronous code in tests:
   - **Callbacks:** You can use the `done` callback to indicate that the test has finished:
     ```javascript
     test('fetches data', done => {
       fetchData((data) => {
         expect(data).toBe('peanut butter');
         done();
       });
     });
     ```
   - **Promises:** You can return a promise from the test:
     ```javascript
     test('fetches data', () => {
       return fetchData().then(data => {
         expect(data).toBe('peanut butter');
       });
     });
     ```
   - **Async/Await:** You can use `async` and `await`:
     ```javascript
     test('fetches data', async () => {
       const data = await fetchData();
       expect(data).toBe('peanut butter');
     });
     ```

### 8. **What is the purpose of `jest.spyOn()` and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** `jest.spyOn()` is used to create a mock function that spies on calls to an existing method. This allows you to track calls to the method and its arguments without changing its implementation.
   Example:
   ```javascript
   const myObject = {
     method: () => 'real implementation'
   };

   const spy = jest.spyOn(myObject, 'method');
   myObject.method();

   expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
   ```

### 9. **How can you test React components using Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test React components using Jest, you can use the `@testing-library/react` or `enzyme` for rendering components and interacting with them in tests. Here’s an example using `@testing-library/react`:
   ```javascript
   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('renders component correctly', () => {
     render(<MyComponent />);
     const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
     expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```
   This test renders the `MyComponent` and verifies that a specific element is present in the document.

### 10. **What are mock functions, and how do you create them in Jest?**
   **Answer:** Mock functions in Jest are used to simulate the behavior of real functions. They allow you to track calls and arguments, set return values, and more. You can create a mock function using `jest.fn()`:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn();

   mockFunction('foo');
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledWith('foo');
   ```

These questions and answers should help you prepare for Jest interviews by covering essential concepts and techniques used in testing with Jest.

Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, continuing from number 11:

### 11. **What is `jest.clearAllMocks()` and when would you use it?**
   **Answer:** `jest.clearAllMocks()` is a utility function that resets all mock functions’ call history. It clears the information about the calls made to the mock functions, but it does not remove their implementation. This is useful when you need to ensure that no previous calls interfere with subsequent tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn();
   mockFunction();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

   jest.clearAllMocks();

   mockFunction();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1); // Not affected by previous calls
   ```

### 12. **What is `jest.resetAllMocks()` and how is it different from `jest.clearAllMocks()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.resetAllMocks()` resets all mock functions by clearing their call history and restoring their initial implementation. In contrast, `jest.clearAllMocks()` only clears the call history but retains the mock implementation.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked');
   mockFunction();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

   jest.resetAllMocks();

   expect(mockFunction()).toBeUndefined(); // Original implementation restored
   ```

### 13. **How does Jest handle testing modules that have side effects?**
   **Answer:** Jest provides `jest.mock()` to mock entire modules, which is particularly useful for handling side effects. By mocking the module, you can isolate the code under test and avoid unwanted side effects. You can also use `jest.spyOn()` to spy on methods of modules without altering their behavior unless necessary.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./sideEffectModule');
   const sideEffectModule = require('./sideEffectModule');

   sideEffectModule.doSomething(); // Does not trigger the actual side effect
   expect(sideEffectModule.doSomething).toHaveBeenCalled();
   ```

### 14. **What are Jest matchers, and how are they used in tests?**
   **Answer:** Jest matchers are functions that allow you to assert different conditions on the values you are testing. Common matchers include `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toBeNull`, `toBeUndefined`, `toHaveBeenCalled`, and many more.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
   expect({ a: 1 }).toEqual({ a: 1 });
   expect(null).toBeNull();
   expect(undefined).toBeUndefined();
   ```

### 15. **How does Jest’s `toMatchObject()` differ from `toEqual()`?**
   **Answer:** `toMatchObject()` is used to check that an object matches a subset of properties, while `toEqual()` checks for deep equality of two objects.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

   expect(obj).toMatchObject({ a: 1, c: 3 }); // Passes
   expect(obj).toEqual({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }); // Passes
   ```

   `toMatchObject()` is useful when you only care about specific properties within an object, while `toEqual()` ensures that the entire object structure and values are the same.

### 16. **What is the purpose of `jest.useFakeTimers()` and when would you use it?**
   **Answer:** `jest.useFakeTimers()` allows you to control the passage of time in your tests. It is particularly useful when testing code that relies on `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or other timing functions. By using fake timers, you can simulate the passage of time without actually waiting.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.useFakeTimers();

   const callback = jest.fn();
   setTimeout(callback, 1000);

   jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);
   expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
   ```

### 17. **How do you test that a function throws an error in Jest?**
   **Answer:** In Jest, you can test if a function throws an error using the `toThrow` matcher. This matcher can be used to check if the function throws an error, and optionally, you can also check for a specific error message.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function throwError() {
     throw new Error('Something went wrong');
   }

   expect(throwError).toThrow();
   expect(throwError).toThrow('Something went wrong');
   ```

### 18. **What is `jest.fn()` and how is it different from `jest.mock()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.fn()` creates a new mock function that you can customize with specific behavior, such as returning values or throwing errors. It is commonly used to replace a real function with a mock implementation in a test.

   `jest.mock()`, on the other hand, is used to mock entire modules, automatically replacing all the module’s exported functions with mock functions.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const myMockFn = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   expect(myMockFn()).toBe('mocked value');

   jest.mock('./myModule');
   const myModule = require('./myModule');
   expect(myModule.myFunction()).toBeUndefined();
   ```

### 19. **How can you test code that involves promises in Jest?**
   **Answer:** You can test code that involves promises in Jest by returning the promise from the test, or using async/await syntax. Jest will wait for the promise to resolve before marking the test as complete.

   Example with Promises:
   ```javascript
   test('resolves to peanut butter', () => {
     return expect(fetchData()).resolves.toBe('peanut butter');
   });
   ```

   Example with async/await:
   ```javascript
   test('resolves to peanut butter', async () => {
     const data = await fetchData();
     expect(data).toBe('peanut butter');
   });
   ```

### 20. **What is the purpose of `jest.mockImplementation()` and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** `jest.mockImplementation()` is used to define a custom implementation for a mock function. This allows you to specify the behavior of the mock function when it is called in a test.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFn = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => 'mocked result');
   expect(mockFn()).toBe('mocked result');
   ```

   This method is particularly useful when you need to simulate complex behavior or different return values during testing.

These additional questions will help you further prepare for Jest-related interview questions, covering more advanced topics and specific use cases.

Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, continuing from number 21:

### 21. **What is `jest.fn().mockReturnValue()` and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** `jest.fn().mockReturnValue()` is used to define the return value of a mock function. It allows you to specify what the mock function should return when it is called during a test.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   This method is useful when you want to simulate specific return values from functions without implementing the actual logic.

### 22. **How can you use Jest to test a function that makes API calls?**
   **Answer:** You can use Jest to test functions that make API calls by mocking the HTTP request module (e.g., `axios`, `fetch`) and controlling the responses. This allows you to simulate different scenarios, such as successful responses, errors, or timeouts.

   Example with `fetch`:
   ```javascript
   global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
     Promise.resolve({
       json: () => Promise.resolve({ data: 'mocked data' }),
     })
   );

   test('fetches data from API', async () => {
     const data = await fetchData();
     expect(data).toEqual({ data: 'mocked data' });
   });
   ```

### 23. **What is `jest.mockReset()` and when should it be used?**
   **Answer:** `jest.mockReset()` resets all information stored in the mock, including any implementation or return values that were set. It does not restore the initial implementation like `jest.resetAllMocks()` does, but it clears any custom behavior or data.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('initial value');
   mockFunction.mockReturnValue('changed value');

   mockFunction();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledWith('changed value');

   mockFunction.mockReset();
   expect(mockFunction()).toBeUndefined(); // Reset to default behavior
   ```

   Use `jest.mockReset()` when you want to clear out custom behavior from previous tests while keeping the mock function itself intact.

### 24. **How do you test code that uses `setTimeout` in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test code that uses `setTimeout` in Jest, you can use Jest’s fake timers with `jest.useFakeTimers()` and `jest.advanceTimersByTime()` to control the passage of time.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.useFakeTimers();

   test('calls function after timeout', () => {
     const callback = jest.fn();
     setTimeout(callback, 1000);

     jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);
     expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
   });
   ```

   This allows you to test the behavior of your code without actually waiting for the timeout duration to pass.

### 25. **What is `jest.spyOn()` and how is it used differently from `jest.fn()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.spyOn()` creates a mock function that can spy on calls to a method of an object while preserving the original implementation. This is different from `jest.fn()`, which creates a standalone mock function.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const myObject = {
     myMethod: () => 'real value',
   };

   const spy = jest.spyOn(myObject, 'myMethod');
   myObject.myMethod();

   expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
   ```

   Use `jest.spyOn()` when you want to track calls to an existing method without overriding its behavior, or when you want to selectively override it.

### 26. **How does Jest handle testing asynchronous code that involves both promises and callbacks?**
   **Answer:** Jest can handle asynchronous code that involves both promises and callbacks by using a combination of `async/await`, returning promises from tests, and using the `done` callback.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   test('asynchronous code with promises and callbacks', async () => {
     const data = await fetchData();
     processData(data, (result) => {
       expect(result).toBe('processed data');
     });
   });
   ```

   If the asynchronous function uses callbacks, you can also use the `done` callback to signal the end of the test:
   ```javascript
   test('asynchronous code with done callback', (done) => {
     fetchDataWithCallback((data) => {
       expect(data).toBe('callback data');
       done();
     });
   });
   ```

### 27. **What is `jest.clearMocks` configuration option and how does it work?**
   **Answer:** The `jest.clearMocks` configuration option, when set to `true` in the Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`), automatically clears mock calls and instances between every test. This ensures that tests do not interfere with each other by using stale data.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     clearMocks: true,
   };
   ```

   With this option enabled, you don’t need to manually clear mocks with `jest.clearAllMocks()` after each test.

### 28. **What are custom matchers in Jest, and how do you create one?**
   **Answer:** Custom matchers in Jest are functions that extend Jest's built-in matchers with additional behavior. They allow you to define your own assertion logic that can be reused across tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   expect.extend({
     toBePositive(received) {
       const pass = received > 0;
       if (pass) {
         return {
           message: () => `expected ${received} not to be positive`,
           pass: true,
         };
       } else {
         return {
           message: () => `expected ${received} to be positive`,
           pass: false,
         };
       }
     },
   });

   test('number is positive', () => {
     expect(5).toBePositive();
   });
   ```

   Custom matchers are useful when you want to add specific assertions that are not covered by Jest's default matchers.

### 29. **How do you generate code coverage reports in Jest?**
   **Answer:** Jest can generate code coverage reports by running tests with the `--coverage` flag. This provides a detailed report showing which lines of code are covered by tests and which are not.

   Example:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

   You can also configure Jest to always generate coverage reports by setting the `collectCoverage` option in your Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`):
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     collectCoverage: true,
   };
   ```

   The coverage report is saved in the `coverage/` directory and includes information on statement, branch, function, and line coverage.

### 30. **What are Jest runners and how do they work?**
   **Answer:** Jest runners are responsible for executing tests and reporting the results. By default, Jest uses its built-in runner, but you can configure custom runners to change how tests are executed. Custom runners can be used to run tests in different environments or add custom behavior during test execution.

   Example of using a custom Jest runner:
   ```javascript
   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     runner: 'jest-runner-eslint',
   };
   ```

   In this example, the Jest runner is configured to use `jest-runner-eslint`, which allows Jest to run ESLint checks as part of the test suite.

These additional questions and answers continue to explore more advanced Jest concepts and tools, providing a deeper understanding of how Jest can be used effectively in testing JavaScript applications.

Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, continuing from number 31:

### 31. **What is the `jest.setup.js` file used for?**
   **Answer:** The `jest.setup.js` file is used to configure or set up the testing environment before each test file runs. It’s a place where you can perform global configurations such as adding custom matchers, mocking modules, or setting up global variables.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   // jest.setup.js
   jest.mock('axios');

   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./jest.setup.js'],
   };
   ```

   This setup file is particularly useful for initializing configurations that need to be shared across multiple test files.

### 32. **How do you test React components with Jest and Enzyme?**
   **Answer:** Jest is commonly used with Enzyme to test React components. Enzyme provides utilities for rendering React components in a test environment and making assertions about their behavior.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('renders without crashing', () => {
     const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);
     expect(wrapper.exists()).toBe(true);
   });

   test('renders a specific element', () => {
     const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);
     expect(wrapper.find('.my-element').length).toBe(1);
   });
   ```

   Enzyme’s `shallow` rendering is useful for unit testing components in isolation, without rendering child components.

### 33. **What are Jest snapshots, and how are they used?**
   **Answer:** Jest snapshots capture the rendered output of a React component or other data structures and store it in a snapshot file. During subsequent test runs, Jest compares the current output to the stored snapshot to detect changes.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('matches the snapshot', () => {
     const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent />).toJSON();
     expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
   });
   ```

   Snapshots are useful for detecting unexpected changes in the UI or data structures. When changes are intentional, you can update the snapshot by running `jest --updateSnapshot`.

### 34. **How do you mock modules in Jest using `jest.mock()`?**
   **Answer:** You can mock modules in Jest using the `jest.mock()` function. This allows you to replace a module’s implementation with a mock for testing purposes.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('axios');
   import axios from 'axios';

   test('makes an API call', async () => {
     axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: 'mocked data' });

     const data = await fetchData();
     expect(data).toBe('mocked data');
   });
   ```

   By mocking the `axios` module, you control its behavior in the test, allowing you to simulate different scenarios without making real API calls.

### 35. **What is `jest.runAllTimers()` and how does it differ from `jest.advanceTimersByTime()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.runAllTimers()` runs all pending timers immediately, regardless of their scheduled time. It is useful when you want to fast-forward through all timers in your test.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.useFakeTimers();

   setTimeout(() => console.log('First timeout'), 1000);
   setTimeout(() => console.log('Second timeout'), 2000);

   jest.runAllTimers();
   // Both timeouts are executed immediately
   ```

   On the other hand, `jest.advanceTimersByTime()` advances the timers by a specified amount of time, allowing you to simulate the passage of time more gradually.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000); // Advances by 1000ms
   ```

### 36. **What is the difference between `jest.spyOn()` and `jest.fn()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.spyOn()` is used to create a mock function that wraps around an existing method of an object, allowing you to spy on calls to that method without changing its implementation. `jest.fn()` creates a standalone mock function that you can fully control.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const myObject = {
     myMethod: () => 'real value',
   };

   const spy = jest.spyOn(myObject, 'myMethod');
   myObject.myMethod();

   expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
   ```

   Use `jest.spyOn()` when you need to monitor calls to a real method, and `jest.fn()` when you want a completely independent mock function.

### 37. **How do you mock return values and implementations with `jest.fn()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.fn()` allows you to mock both return values and custom implementations of a function. You can use `mockReturnValue` to specify a return value, or `mockImplementation` to define a custom function implementation.

   Example with `mockReturnValue`:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   Example with `mockImplementation`:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => 'custom implementation');
   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('custom implementation');
   ```

### 38. **What is `jest.isolateModules()` and when would you use it?**
   **Answer:** `jest.isolateModules()` is used to isolate the execution of a module in a test, ensuring that the module’s dependencies are not cached across different tests. This is useful when you want to test a module in a clean environment without interference from previous tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.isolateModules(() => {
     const myModule = require('./myModule');
     // Test myModule in isolation
   });
   ```

   Use `jest.isolateModules()` when you need to ensure that a module is loaded fresh for each test, avoiding any side effects from module caching.

### 39. **How do you test Redux actions and reducers with Jest?**
   **Answer:** You can test Redux actions by dispatching them and asserting their return values. Reducers can be tested by providing an initial state and an action, and then checking if the returned state is correct.

   Example for actions:
   ```javascript
   import { myAction } from './actions';

   test('creates the correct action', () => {
     const expectedAction = {
       type: 'MY_ACTION',
       payload: 'data',
     };
     expect(myAction('data')).toEqual(expectedAction);
   });
   ```

   Example for reducers:
   ```javascript
   import myReducer from './reducers';

   test('returns the correct state', () => {
     const initialState = { value: 0 };
     const action = { type: 'INCREMENT' };
     const expectedState = { value: 1 };

     expect(myReducer(initialState, action)).toEqual(expectedState);
   });
   ```

### 40. **What is the purpose of `jest.resetModules()` and when should it be used?**
   **Answer:** `jest.resetModules()` resets the module registry, ensuring that all modules are freshly required the next time they are imported. This is useful when you need to test module behavior in isolation or when you want to avoid side effects from previous tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.resetModules();

   const myModule = require('./myModule');
   // Test myModule with a clean state
   ```

   Use `jest.resetModules()` when you need to ensure that each test starts with a clean slate, especially when working with modules that have side effects or stateful dependencies.

These additional questions and answers continue to delve into more advanced Jest topics, helping you build a comprehensive understanding of Jest's features and best practices for testing JavaScript applications.


Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, continuing from number 41:

### 41. **How do you use `jest.clearAllMocks()` and `jest.resetAllMocks()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.clearAllMocks()` and `jest.resetAllMocks()` are utility functions used to manage the state of mock functions between tests.

   - **`jest.clearAllMocks()`**: Clears all information stored in mocks, such as call history and instances, but keeps the original mock implementation intact. It is useful when you want to clear the history of all mocks but continue using their current implementation.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn();
   mockFunction();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

   jest.clearAllMocks();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0);
   ```

   - **`jest.resetAllMocks()`**: Resets all mock functions to their initial state, including clearing call history, instances, and any mock implementation or return values. It is useful when you want to completely reset the mocks between tests to avoid any shared state.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('value');
   mockFunction();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();

   jest.resetAllMocks();
   expect(mockFunction()).toBeUndefined(); // Resets the return value
   ```

### 42. **What are mock implementations and how are they different from mock return values in Jest?**
   **Answer:** Mock implementations define the behavior of a mock function when it is called, allowing you to control the logic inside the function. Mock return values, on the other hand, simply specify what the function should return when called.

   - **Mock Implementation**: 
     ```javascript
     const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockImplementation((x) => x * 2);
     expect(mockFunction(2)).toBe(4);
     ```

   - **Mock Return Value**:
     ```javascript
     const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(5);
     expect(mockFunction()).toBe(5);
     ```

   Mock implementations are more flexible as they allow you to define complex behaviors based on the input, whereas mock return values are simpler and only provide a fixed output.

### 43. **How do you mock classes in Jest?**
   **Answer:** You can mock classes in Jest using `jest.mock()`. This allows you to replace the class with a mock constructor and mock methods on the prototype.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./MyClass');
   const MyClass = require('./MyClass');

   MyClass.mockImplementation(() => {
     return {
       myMethod: jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked value'),
     };
   });

   const instance = new MyClass();
   expect(instance.myMethod()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   This is useful when you want to test code that depends on class instances without invoking the real class constructor or methods.

### 44. **What is the difference between `jest.doMock()` and `jest.dontMock()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.doMock()` and `jest.dontMock()` are used to toggle the mocking behavior for modules in Jest.

   - **`jest.doMock()`**: Ensures that a module is mocked, even if it was previously marked with `jest.dontMock()`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.dontMock('./myModule');
   jest.doMock('./myModule'); // Re-mocks the module
   ```

   - **`jest.dontMock()`**: Prevents Jest from automatically mocking a module, even if `jest.mock()` was called.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.dontMock('./myModule');
   const myModule = require('./myModule');
   expect(myModule.realMethod).toBeDefined(); // Uses the real method
   ```

   These functions are useful when you need to control the mocking behavior of modules dynamically within a test file.

### 45. **How do you test React hooks with Jest?**
   **Answer:** Testing React hooks with Jest typically involves using the `@testing-library/react-hooks` library or manually testing the component that uses the hook.

   Example using `@testing-library/react-hooks`:
   ```javascript
   import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
   import useCustomHook from './useCustomHook';

   test('should update state', () => {
     const { result } = renderHook(() => useCustomHook());

     act(() => {
       result.current.increment();
     });

     expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);
   });
   ```

   This library allows you to test hooks directly, which is particularly useful for custom hooks that manage complex state or side effects.

### 46. **What is `jest.spyOn(object, methodName)` used for?**
   **Answer:** `jest.spyOn(object, methodName)` is used to create a mock function that wraps around an existing method of an object. It allows you to spy on the method's calls and optionally control its behavior without completely replacing it.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     method: () => 'real value',
   };

   const spy = jest.spyOn(obj, 'method');
   obj.method();

   expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
   expect(spy).toHaveReturnedWith('real value');
   ```

   `jest.spyOn()` is useful when you want to observe interactions with a method while preserving its original implementation.

### 47. **How do you mock static methods in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock static methods in Jest, you can use `jest.spyOn()` on the class itself, or you can mock the entire class.

   Example using `jest.spyOn()`:
   ```javascript
   class MyClass {
     static myStaticMethod() {
       return 'real value';
     }
   }

   jest.spyOn(MyClass, 'myStaticMethod').mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   expect(MyClass.myStaticMethod()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   This approach allows you to control the behavior of static methods in your tests.

### 48. **What is the purpose of `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()` is used to run only the timers that are currently pending (i.e., those that are scheduled but not yet executed). This is useful for testing code that relies on multiple timers and you only want to advance specific ones.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.useFakeTimers();

   setTimeout(() => console.log('First timeout'), 1000);
   setTimeout(() => console.log('Second timeout'), 2000);

   jest.runOnlyPendingTimers();
   // Only the first timeout is executed
   ```

   This function allows you to control the execution of specific timers without advancing all timers at once.

### 49. **How can you test private functions in Jest?**
   **Answer:** In JavaScript, private functions are not accessible outside the module where they are defined, so they are typically tested indirectly by testing the public methods that use them. However, if you need to test a private function directly, you can export it conditionally or use a tool like `rewire`.

   Example with conditional export:
   ```javascript
   // myModule.js
   function privateFunction() {
     return 'private';
   }

   export const publicFunction = () => privateFunction();

   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test') {
     export { privateFunction };
   }
   ```

   Example with `rewire`:
   ```javascript
   const rewire = require('rewire');
   const myModule = rewire('./myModule');
   const privateFunction = myModule.__get__('privateFunction');

   test('tests private function', () => {
     expect(privateFunction()).toBe('private');
   });
   ```

   Testing private functions directly is generally discouraged in favor of testing the public API, but these techniques can be used if necessary.

### 50. **What is the difference between `jest.mock()` and `jest.genMockFromModule()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.mock()` is used to automatically mock an entire module or specific functions within a module. It replaces the real implementation with a mock that can be controlled during testing.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./myModule');
   const myModule = require('./myModule');
   myModule.myFunction.mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   ```

   `jest.genMockFromModule()` generates a mock from a module, but does not automatically replace the original module. Instead, it returns a mock object that you can use manually.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockModule = jest.genMockFromModule('./myModule');
   mockModule.myFunction.mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   ```

   Use `jest.mock()` when you want to replace the entire module automatically, and `jest.genMockFromModule()` when you need a mock object that you can use in a more controlled way.

These questions and answers further explore advanced Jest topics, providing you with a deeper understanding of how Jest can be used effectively in various testing scenarios.


Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, continuing from number 51:

### 51. **How do you use `jest.useRealTimers()` and `jest.useFakeTimers()` in Jest?**
   **Answer:** `jest.useRealTimers()` and `jest.useFakeTimers()` are used to switch between real and fake timers in Jest tests.

   - **`jest.useFakeTimers()`**: Replaces the real timer functions (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`, etc.) with mock versions, allowing you to control the passage of time in your tests.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.useFakeTimers();
   const callback = jest.fn();

   setTimeout(callback, 1000);
   jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);

   expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
   ```

   - **`jest.useRealTimers()`**: Reverts back to using the real timer functions after they were replaced with mock versions.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.useFakeTimers();
   // Mock timers in use
   jest.useRealTimers();
   // Real timers in use
   ```

   These functions are useful when you need to test time-based code and control the timing in your tests.

### 52. **What is `jest.isMockFunction()` used for?**
   **Answer:** `jest.isMockFunction()` is a utility function used to check if a given function is a Jest mock function. This is useful when you need to verify whether a function has been mocked in your tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn();
   const regularFunction = () => {};

   expect(jest.isMockFunction(mockFunction)).toBe(true);
   expect(jest.isMockFunction(regularFunction)).toBe(false);
   ```

   This function helps ensure that the functions you are testing or verifying are indeed mocked versions.

### 53. **How do you test asynchronous code with Jest?**
   **Answer:** Testing asynchronous code in Jest can be done using `async/await`, returning a promise, or using callback functions. Jest waits for the promise to resolve or reject before marking the test as complete.

   Example with `async/await`:
   ```javascript
   test('async function resolves', async () => {
     const data = await fetchData();
     expect(data).toBe('resolved value');
   });
   ```

   Example by returning a promise:
   ```javascript
   test('async function resolves', () => {
     return fetchData().then(data => {
       expect(data).toBe('resolved value');
     });
   });
   ```

   Example with callbacks:
   ```javascript
   test('async function with callback', (done) => {
     fetchDataCallback((data) => {
       expect(data).toBe('resolved value');
       done();
     });
   });
   ```

   These methods ensure that your tests handle asynchronous operations correctly.

### 54. **What is the purpose of `jest.setTimeout()` in Jest tests?**
   **Answer:** `jest.setTimeout()` is used to set the maximum time a test can run before Jest automatically fails it due to a timeout. This is useful for tests that involve long-running operations or when testing with fake timers.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.setTimeout(10000); // Set timeout to 10 seconds

   test('long-running test', async () => {
     const data = await longRunningOperation();
     expect(data).toBe('result');
   });
   ```

   By increasing the timeout with `jest.setTimeout()`, you can ensure that long-running tests have enough time to complete without prematurely failing.

### 55. **How do you mock a function inside a module using `jest.fn()`?**
   **Answer:** To mock a function inside a module, you can use `jest.mock()` to automatically mock the entire module, or you can use `jest.fn()` to mock specific functions within the module.

   Example with `jest.mock()`:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./myModule');
   const { myFunction } = require('./myModule');

   myFunction.mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   expect(myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   Example with `jest.fn()`:
   ```javascript
   const myModule = require('./myModule');
   myModule.myFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked value');

   expect(myModule.myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   This allows you to control the behavior of specific functions within a module during testing.

### 56. **How do you mock global objects like `window` or `document` in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock global objects like `window` or `document`, you can assign mock implementations directly to these objects.

   Example for mocking `window`:
   ```javascript
   global.window = Object.create(window);
   Object.defineProperty(window, 'location', {
     value: {
       href: 'https://example.com',
     },
   });

   test('checks window.location', () => {
     expect(window.location.href).toBe('https://example.com');
   });
   ```

   Example for mocking `document`:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById = jest.fn(() => ({
     innerHTML: 'mocked content',
   }));

   test('checks document.getElementById', () => {
     const element = document.getElementById('test');
     expect(element.innerHTML).toBe('mocked content');
   });
   ```

   This technique is useful when testing code that interacts with browser-specific global objects.

### 57. **How do you mock a module partially in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock a module partially in Jest, you can use `jest.requireActual()` to import the original module and then override specific methods or properties.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./myModule', () => {
     const originalModule = jest.requireActual('./myModule');
     return {
       ...originalModule,
       myFunction: jest.fn(() => 'mocked value'),
     };
   });

   const { myFunction, anotherFunction } = require('./myModule');

   expect(myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   expect(anotherFunction()).toBe('real value');
   ```

   This approach allows you to mock specific parts of a module while keeping the rest of the module intact.

### 58. **How do you use Jest with TypeScript?**
   **Answer:** Jest can be used with TypeScript by configuring it to understand TypeScript files. This typically involves installing `ts-jest`, which is a TypeScript preprocessor for Jest, and configuring `jest.config.js`.

   Example `jest.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     preset: 'ts-jest',
     testEnvironment: 'node',
     testMatch: ['**/*.test.ts'],
   };
   ```

   Example TypeScript test:
   ```typescript
   import { add } from './add';

   test('adds two numbers', () => {
     expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
   });
   ```

   This setup allows you to write and run tests in TypeScript, leveraging TypeScript's type checking in your Jest tests.

### 59. **What is `jest.fn().mockResolvedValue()` and when would you use it?**
   **Answer:** `jest.fn().mockResolvedValue()` is used to mock a function that returns a promise that resolves with a specified value. This is useful for testing asynchronous functions that rely on promises.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('resolved value');

   test('async function resolves', async () => {
     const result = await mockFunction();
     expect(result).toBe('resolved value');
   });
   ```

   This is particularly useful when you want to mock API calls or other asynchronous operations in your tests.

### 60. **How do you mock a Node.js module like `fs` in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock a Node.js module like `fs`, you can use `jest.mock()` to automatically mock the module or manually mock specific methods using `jest.fn()`.

   Example with automatic mocking:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('fs');
   const fs = require('fs');

   fs.readFileSync.mockReturnValue('mocked file content');

   test('reads a file', () => {
     const content = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/file');
     expect(content).toBe('mocked file content');
   });
   ```

   Example with manual mocking:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');

   jest.spyOn(fs, 'readFileSync').mockReturnValue('mocked file content');

   test('reads a file', () => {
     const content = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/file');
     expect(content).toBe('mocked file content');
   });
   ```

   This approach allows you to control the behavior of Node.js core modules in your Jest tests.

These additional questions and answers delve deeper into Jest's advanced features and techniques, helping you understand how to effectively use Jest for testing in various scenarios.

Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, starting from number 61:

### 61. **How do you mock `axios` in Jest for testing HTTP requests?**
   **Answer:** To mock `axios` in Jest, you can use `jest.mock('axios')` and then mock the specific methods like `get`, `post`, etc., that you need for your test cases.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const axios = require('axios');
   const fetchData = require('./fetchData');

   jest.mock('axios');

   test('fetches successfully data from an API', async () => {
     const data = { data: 'mocked data' };
     axios.get.mockResolvedValue(data);

     const result = await fetchData();
     expect(result).toBe('mocked data');
   });
   ```

   This allows you to mock API requests in your tests without making actual HTTP requests.

### 62. **What is the purpose of `jest.clearAllMocks()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.clearAllMocks()` is used to reset all mocks in Jest to their initial state. This is useful when you want to ensure that mocks do not retain any state, calls, or implementation from previous tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn();

   mockFunction();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();

   jest.clearAllMocks();

   expect(mockFunction).not.toHaveBeenCalled(); // Clears call history
   ```

   This ensures a clean state for each test, reducing the risk of test interdependencies.

### 63. **How do you test a React component with Jest and Enzyme?**
   **Answer:** Jest can be used with Enzyme to test React components by rendering the component using Enzyme's `shallow`, `mount`, or `render` methods, and then asserting the component's output or behavior.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('renders correctly', () => {
     const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);
     expect(wrapper.find('div').text()).toBe('Hello World');
   });
   ```

   In this example, `shallow` rendering is used to create an isolated test for the component, ensuring it renders as expected.

### 64. **How do you use Jest to test React hooks like `useEffect`?**
   **Answer:** To test React hooks like `useEffect`, you can use Jest with `@testing-library/react-hooks` or mock the behavior of `useEffect` using `jest.spyOn`.

   Example with `@testing-library/react-hooks`:
   ```javascript
   import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
   import useCustomHook from './useCustomHook';

   test('should call useEffect', () => {
     const { result } = renderHook(() => useCustomHook());

     expect(result.current.someState).toBe('expected value');
   });
   ```

   Example with `jest.spyOn`:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
   import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('calls useEffect on mount', () => {
     jest.spyOn(React, 'useEffect').mockImplementationOnce(() => {});

     shallow(<MyComponent />);
     expect(React.useEffect).toHaveBeenCalled();
   });
   ```

   These methods help in testing components that rely on side effects managed by `useEffect`.

### 65. **What is the purpose of `jest.spyOn()` and how is it different from `jest.fn()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.spyOn()` is used to spy on existing methods of objects or classes, allowing you to monitor and mock them without changing the implementation. In contrast, `jest.fn()` creates a mock function from scratch.

   Example with `jest.spyOn()`:
   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     method: () => 'original value',
   };

   jest.spyOn(obj, 'method').mockReturnValue('mocked value');

   expect(obj.method()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   Example with `jest.fn()`:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn(() => 'mocked value');

   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   `jest.spyOn()` is particularly useful when you want to mock specific methods of an object or class without affecting other parts of the implementation.

### 66. **How do you mock implementation of a function only for one test in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock the implementation of a function for only one test, you can use `jest.fn()` or `jest.spyOn()` within the specific test, and then restore the original implementation after the test using `mockRestore()`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const myFunction = jest.fn(() => 'original value');

   test('mocks function implementation', () => {
     myFunction.mockImplementationOnce(() => 'mocked value');
     expect(myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   });

   test('uses original implementation', () => {
     expect(myFunction()).toBe('original value');
   });
   ```

   This technique allows you to temporarily override a function's behavior for a single test without affecting other tests.

### 67. **How do you test a component that uses `useContext` in React with Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test a component that uses `useContext`, you can mock the context value using a custom provider or by directly mocking the `React.useContext` hook.

   Example with a custom provider:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
   import { MyContext } from './MyContext';

   test('renders with context value', () => {
     const contextValue = { someValue: 'test value' };

     const { getByText } = render(
       <MyContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
         <MyComponent />
       </MyContext.Provider>
     );

     expect(getByText('test value')).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

   This method ensures that your component receives the correct context value during testing.

### 68. **What is the difference between `jest.fn()` and `jest.mock()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.fn()` creates a mock function that can be used in place of any function in your code, while `jest.mock()` automatically mocks an entire module or a specific import from a module.

   Example with `jest.fn()`:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn(() => 'mocked value');

   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   Example with `jest.mock()`:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./myModule');
   const { myFunction } = require('./myModule');

   myFunction.mockReturnValue('mocked value');
   expect(myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
   ```

   `jest.fn()` is used when you want to manually create a mock function, while `jest.mock()` is used to automatically mock dependencies or modules.

### 69. **How do you test if a React component throws an error using Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test if a React component throws an error, you can use Jest's `toThrow` matcher or wrap the component rendering in a function that you pass to `expect`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('throws an error', () => {
     const renderWithError = () => render(<MyComponent />);

     expect(renderWithError).toThrow('Expected error');
   });
   ```

   This approach helps you verify that your component properly handles or throws errors as expected.

### 70. **How do you handle `console.error` messages during Jest tests?**
   **Answer:** To handle `console.error` messages during Jest tests, you can mock `console.error` using `jest.spyOn` or `jest.fn` to silence or assert on specific log messages.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.spyOn(global.console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});

   test('suppresses console.error', () => {
     console.error('This is an error message');
     expect(console.error).toHaveBeenCalled();
   });

   afterAll(() => {
     console.error.mockRestore();
   });
   ```

   This technique is useful for keeping your test output clean or verifying that certain error messages are logged.

These questions delve further into Jest's capabilities, providing a deeper understanding of how to handle various testing scenarios in JavaScript and React environments.


Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, starting from number 71:

### 71. **How do you use `jest.useFakeTimers()` in your tests?**
   **Answer:** `jest.useFakeTimers()` allows you to mock or control functions that deal with time in JavaScript, such as `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `Date`. This is useful for testing code that depends on timers without having to wait for real time to pass.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.useFakeTimers();

   test('calls the callback after 1 second', () => {
     const callback = jest.fn();

     setTimeout(callback, 1000);
     jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);

     expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
   });

   afterEach(() => {
     jest.useRealTimers(); // Restore real timers after test
   });
   ```

   This approach enables precise control over time-dependent code in tests.

### 72. **What is `jest.isolateModules()` and when would you use it?**
   **Answer:** `jest.isolateModules()` is used to isolate module imports within a test, ensuring that they are loaded fresh for each test case. This is useful when you want to avoid module caching issues or when you want to test the behavior of a module with different mocks in different tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   test('isolates module imports', () => {
     jest.isolateModules(() => {
       const myModule = require('./myModule');
       expect(myModule.someFunction()).toBe('expected value');
     });
   });
   ```

   By isolating module imports, you can ensure that each test case is independent and does not interfere with others.

### 73. **How do you mock a default export in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock a default export in Jest, you use `jest.mock()` along with a factory function that returns a mock implementation of the default export.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./myModule', () => ({
     __esModule: true,  // This property makes sure that it's treated as an ES module
     default: jest.fn(() => 'mocked default export'),
   }));

   const myModule = require('./myModule');

   test('mocks default export', () => {
     expect(myModule.default()).toBe('mocked default export');
   });
   ```

   This method is useful for testing modules that export a single function or class as the default export.

### 74. **How do you test asynchronous code in Jest?**
   **Answer:** Testing asynchronous code in Jest can be done using `async/await`, `promises`, or callbacks, depending on how the asynchronous code is structured. The key is to return a promise or use `async/await` in the test to ensure Jest waits for the asynchronous code to complete.

   Example with `async/await`:
   ```javascript
   test('resolves to a value', async () => {
     const result = await someAsyncFunction();
     expect(result).toBe('expected value');
   });
   ```

   Example with promises:
   ```javascript
   test('resolves to a value', () => {
     return someAsyncFunction().then(result => {
       expect(result).toBe('expected value');
     });
   });
   ```

   Ensuring that the test waits for the asynchronous code to complete is crucial for accurate testing.

### 75. **What is the purpose of `jest.resetModules()`?**
   **Answer:** `jest.resetModules()` resets the module registry, which means that all modules that were previously `require`d are removed from the cache and will be reloaded when required again. This is useful in situations where you want to ensure that each test starts with a clean slate, without any module-level state carried over from previous tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   test('resets module registry', () => {
     jest.resetModules();
     const myModule = require('./myModule');
     expect(myModule.someFunction()).toBe('new value');
   });
   ```

   This method is helpful when tests might be affected by stateful modules or when testing different scenarios involving the same module.

### 76. **How do you mock a specific method in a class using Jest?**
   **Answer:** You can mock a specific method in a class by using `jest.spyOn()` to spy on the method and then mock its implementation.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   class MyClass {
     myMethod() {
       return 'original value';
     }
   }

   test('mocks a specific method in a class', () => {
     const instance = new MyClass();
     jest.spyOn(instance, 'myMethod').mockReturnValue('mocked value');

     expect(instance.myMethod()).toBe('mocked value');
   });
   ```

   This allows you to replace the original method implementation with a mock for the duration of the test.

### 77. **How do you use `jest.mockReturnValueOnce()` and when is it useful?**
   **Answer:** `jest.mockReturnValueOnce()` is used to specify a mock return value for a single call to a mock function. Subsequent calls will use the default implementation or return value unless additional `mockReturnValueOnce()` calls are made.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn();

   mockFunction.mockReturnValueOnce('first call').mockReturnValueOnce('second call');

   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('first call');
   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('second call');
   expect(mockFunction()).toBeUndefined(); // No more return values specified
   ```

   This is useful when you want to test how a function behaves with different return values on consecutive calls.

### 78. **What is the `expect.any()` matcher in Jest and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** `expect.any()` is a matcher in Jest that allows you to assert that a value is of a certain type, regardless of the specific value. It’s useful when you care about the type of the value rather than the exact value.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   test('matches any number', () => {
     const mockFunction = jest.fn();
     mockFunction(123);

     expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(Number));
   });
   ```

   This matcher is handy when you’re dealing with values that are variable but of a specific type, like IDs or timestamps.

### 79. **How do you mock a named export from a module in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock a named export from a module in Jest, you use `jest.mock()` and provide a factory function that returns the named export as a mock function.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./myModule', () => ({
     namedExport: jest.fn(() => 'mocked value'),
   }));

   const { namedExport } = require('./myModule');

   test('mocks named export', () => {
     expect(namedExport()).toBe('mocked value');
   });
   ```

   This allows you to control the behavior of specific named exports in your tests.

### 80. **How do you test for thrown exceptions in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test for thrown exceptions in Jest, you can use the `toThrow` matcher. You need to wrap the function that throws the exception in another function passed to `expect`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function throwError() {
     throw new Error('Something went wrong');
   }

   test('throws an error', () => {
     expect(() => throwError()).toThrow('Something went wrong');
   });
   ```

   This ensures that your test correctly verifies that an exception is thrown when expected.

These additional questions cover more advanced scenarios in Jest, helping you prepare for in-depth discussions on testing strategies and best practices.


Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, starting from number 81:

### 81. **How do you mock a module only for a specific test in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock a module only for a specific test in Jest, you can use `jest.doMock()` or manually mock and unmock the module within the test.

   Example using `jest.doMock()`:
   ```javascript
   test('mocks module for this test only', () => {
     jest.doMock('./myModule', () => ({
       myFunction: jest.fn(() => 'mocked value'),
     }));

     const { myFunction } = require('./myModule');
     expect(myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
     
     jest.dontMock('./myModule'); // Restore original behavior
   });
   ```

   By using `jest.doMock()`, the module is mocked only for that specific test, and the original module is restored afterward.

### 82. **What is `jest.mockImplementationOnce()` and when would you use it?**
   **Answer:** `jest.mockImplementationOnce()` allows you to define the implementation of a mock function for a single call. It's particularly useful when you want to test how a function behaves differently on consecutive calls.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn();

   mockFunction.mockImplementationOnce(() => 'first call')
               .mockImplementationOnce(() => 'second call');

   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('first call');
   expect(mockFunction()).toBe('second call');
   expect(mockFunction()).toBeUndefined(); // No implementation defined for further calls
   ```

   This is useful when the function you're testing should return different results on different calls, like handling multiple asynchronous requests.

### 83. **How do you test a function that calls another function using Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test a function that calls another function, you can use `jest.fn()` to mock the called function and then assert that it was called with the correct arguments.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const helperFunction = jest.fn();
   const mainFunction = (x) => helperFunction(x * 2);

   test('calls helperFunction with correct argument', () => {
     mainFunction(5);
     expect(helperFunction).toHaveBeenCalledWith(10);
   });
   ```

   This verifies that `mainFunction` correctly interacts with `helperFunction`, ensuring the right argument is passed.

### 84. **How do you mock a constructor in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock a constructor in Jest, you can use `jest.mock()` or manually mock the constructor using `jest.fn()`.

   Example using `jest.mock()`:
   ```javascript
   jest.mock('./MyClass', () => {
     return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
       return { myMethod: jest.fn() };
     });
   });

   const MyClass = require('./MyClass');
   const instance = new MyClass();
   instance.myMethod();

   expect(MyClass).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
   expect(instance.myMethod).toHaveBeenCalled();
   ```

   This approach allows you to test how the constructor and its methods are used in your code without relying on the actual implementation.

### 85. **What is the difference between `jest.resetAllMocks()` and `jest.clearAllMocks()`?**
   **Answer:** 
   - `jest.resetAllMocks()` resets the state of all mocks, including clearing their calls, and also removes any custom implementations or return values.
   - `jest.clearAllMocks()` only clears the call history of all mocks but retains any custom implementations or return values.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked value');

   mockFunction();
   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();

   jest.clearAllMocks();
   expect(mockFunction).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

   jest.resetAllMocks();
   expect(mockFunction()).toBeUndefined(); // Custom return value is reset
   ```

   Use `resetAllMocks()` when you want a completely fresh start for mocks, and `clearAllMocks()` when you only need to reset the call history.

### 86. **How can you test private functions in Jest?**
   **Answer:** Testing private functions directly is generally not recommended, as it breaks encapsulation. However, if necessary, you can:
   1. Test the public interface that uses the private functions, ensuring they work as expected.
   2. Temporarily expose the private function by exporting it (not recommended for production code).

   Example by testing through the public interface:
   ```javascript
   class MyClass {
     #privateMethod() {
       return 'private value';
     }

     publicMethod() {
       return this.#privateMethod();
     }
   }

   test('public method calls private method', () => {
     const instance = new MyClass();
     expect(instance.publicMethod()).toBe('private value');
   });
   ```

   This ensures that your private functions are tested indirectly through the public interface.

### 87. **How do you mock a file system module like `fs` in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock a file system module like `fs`, you can use `jest.mock('fs')` and then mock specific methods such as `readFileSync` or `writeFileSync`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   jest.mock('fs');

   test('reads a file', () => {
     fs.readFileSync.mockReturnValue('file content');
     const content = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/file');
     expect(content).toBe('file content');
   });
   ```

   This allows you to test code that interacts with the file system without actually reading or writing files.

### 88. **How do you test Redux actions and reducers with Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test Redux actions and reducers, you can:
   1. Test actions by dispatching them and checking the dispatched type and payload.
   2. Test reducers by passing the current state and action to the reducer and asserting the new state.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   // Action
   const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });

   // Reducer
   const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
     switch (action.type) {
       case 'INCREMENT':
         return state + 1;
       default:
         return state;
     }
   };

   test('increments counter', () => {
     const action = increment();
     const newState = counterReducer(0, action);
     expect(newState).toBe(1);
   });
   ```

   This method ensures that your Redux logic is functioning as expected.

### 89. **How do you test a component with conditional rendering in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test a component with conditional rendering, you can render the component with different props or states and check whether the correct elements are rendered.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('renders loading state', () => {
     const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent loading={true} />);
     expect(getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();
   });

   test('renders content state', () => {
     const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent loading={false} />);
     expect(getByText('Content loaded')).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

   This approach allows you to verify that your component behaves correctly under different conditions.

### 90. **What is the `expect.assertions()` function in Jest, and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** `expect.assertions(number)` is used to specify the number of assertions that should be called in a test. It ensures that a certain number of `expect()` statements are executed, which is especially useful in asynchronous tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   test('ensures the correct number of assertions', async () => {
     expect.assertions(2);

     const data = await someAsyncFunction();
     expect(data).toBe('expected data');
     expect(data.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
   });
   ```

   This function is helpful to verify that all expected assertions are actually reached during the test.

These questions provide additional insight into advanced Jest usage, focusing on specific features and testing techniques that are crucial for more complex testing scenarios.


Here are more Jest interview questions and answers, starting from number 91:

### 91. **How do you test a React component with useEffect using Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test a React component with `useEffect`, you can render the component and then assert the changes made by `useEffect`, such as state updates, API calls, or DOM changes. Additionally, you can mock any dependencies like API calls using Jest.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
   import axios from 'axios';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   jest.mock('axios');

   const MyComponent = () => {
     const [data, setData] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       axios.get('/api/data').then((response) => setData(response.data));
     }, []);

     return <div>{data ? data : 'Loading...'}</div>;
   };

   test('fetches data and updates the component', async () => {
     axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: 'Hello World' });
     render(<MyComponent />);

     expect(await screen.findByText('Hello World')).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

   This approach allows you to test the effects of `useEffect`, including asynchronous operations.

### 92. **What is `jest.fn().mockResolvedValue()` and when would you use it?**
   **Answer:** `jest.fn().mockResolvedValue()` is used to mock a function that returns a promise that resolves to a specified value. It’s useful when you want to simulate asynchronous functions like API calls in your tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const asyncFunction = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('resolved value');

   test('mocks a resolved promise', async () => {
     const result = await asyncFunction();
     expect(result).toBe('resolved value');
   });
   ```

   This method is handy when testing code that relies on promises without needing to execute the actual asynchronous logic.

### 93. **How do you mock a function that returns a promise using Jest?**
   **Answer:** You can mock a function that returns a promise using `jest.fn().mockResolvedValue()` for resolved promises or `jest.fn().mockRejectedValue()` for rejected promises.

   Example for a resolved promise:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('resolved value');

   test('handles resolved promise', async () => {
     const result = await mockFunction();
     expect(result).toBe('resolved value');
   });
   ```

   Example for a rejected promise:
   ```javascript
   const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockRejectedValue('error');

   test('handles rejected promise', async () => {
     await expect(mockFunction()).rejects.toBe('error');
   });
   ```

   This approach is essential for testing code that handles promises, ensuring you can simulate various outcomes.

### 94. **How can you test custom hooks in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test custom hooks in Jest, you can use the `@testing-library/react-hooks` package, which provides utilities for testing hooks in isolation.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
   import useCustomHook from './useCustomHook';

   test('should update state on action', () => {
     const { result } = renderHook(() => useCustomHook());

     act(() => {
       result.current.updateValue('new value');
     });

     expect(result.current.value).toBe('new value');
   });
   ```

   This method allows you to test the logic inside your custom hooks independently of the components that use them.

### 95. **How do you test a component that uses `useContext` in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test a component that uses `useContext`, you can provide a mocked context value using a `Context.Provider` in the test.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useContext } from 'react';
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyContext from './MyContext';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   const MyComponent = () => {
     const value = useContext(MyContext);
     return <div>{value}</div>;
   };

   test('renders component with context value', () => {
     render(
       <MyContext.Provider value="mocked value">
         <MyComponent />
       </MyContext.Provider>
     );

     expect(screen.getByText('mocked value')).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

   By providing a mocked context, you can control the value that `useContext` returns, ensuring your component behaves correctly under different conditions.

### 96. **What is `jest.spyOn()` and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** `jest.spyOn()` is used to create a mock function that spies on the calls to a specific method of an object. It allows you to monitor calls and optionally provide custom implementations.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const myObject = {
     myMethod: () => 'real value',
   };

   test('spies on myMethod', () => {
     const spy = jest.spyOn(myObject, 'myMethod').mockReturnValue('mocked value');

     expect(myObject.myMethod()).toBe('mocked value');
     expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();

     spy.mockRestore(); // Restore original method after the test
   });
   ```

   This is useful when you want to observe the behavior of a method without completely replacing it.

### 97. **How do you test a React component that uses a third-party library in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To test a React component that uses a third-party library, you can mock the library or its specific methods to control its behavior in your tests.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
   import thirdPartyLibrary from 'third-party-library';

   jest.mock('third-party-library', () => ({
     someMethod: jest.fn(() => 'mocked value'),
   }));

   test('renders component with mocked library', () => {
     render(<MyComponent />);
     expect(thirdPartyLibrary.someMethod).toHaveBeenCalled();
     expect(screen.getByText('mocked value')).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

   This approach ensures that your tests are independent of the actual implementation of the third-party library, focusing instead on how your component interacts with it.

### 98. **What are the common matchers provided by Jest for assertions?**
   **Answer:** Jest provides a variety of matchers for making assertions in tests. Some common matchers include:
   - `toBe(value)`: Checks if a value is exactly equal (===) to the expected value.
   - `toEqual(value)`: Checks if a value deeply equals the expected value (for objects or arrays).
   - `toBeNull()`: Checks if a value is `null`.
   - `toBeDefined()`: Checks if a value is not `undefined`.
   - `toContain(item)`: Checks if an array or string contains a specific item.
   - `toHaveLength(number)`: Checks if an array or string has a specific length.
   - `toHaveProperty(keyPath, value?)`: Checks if an object has a specific property, optionally with a specific value.
   - `toThrow(error?)`: Checks if a function throws an error, optionally matching the specific error message.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
   expect([1, 2, 3]).toContain(2);
   expect({ name: 'John' }).toHaveProperty('name', 'John');
   ```

   These matchers cover a wide range of use cases for making assertions in your tests.

### 99. **How do you test component lifecycle methods in Jest?**
   **Answer:** In modern React with hooks, lifecycle methods are often replaced with `useEffect`. However, for class components, you can test lifecycle methods by using `jest.spyOn()` to monitor when they are called.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('componentDidMount is called', () => {
     const componentDidMountSpy = jest.spyOn(MyComponent.prototype, 'componentDidMount');

     render(<MyComponent />);
     expect(componentDidMountSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();

     componentDidMountSpy.mockRestore();
   });
   ```

   This approach allows you to ensure that lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, or `componentWillUnmount` are called as expected.

### 100. **How do you mock global objects like `window` or `document` in Jest?**
   **Answer:** To mock global objects like `window` or `document` in Jest, you can either override their properties directly or use `jest.spyOn()` to create spies on specific methods or properties. Here’s how you can do it:

### Mocking `window`

#### 1. **Mocking `window` Properties Directly**

You can directly set or override properties on the `window` object within your tests. This is useful for testing code that interacts with the global `window` object.

Example:
```javascript
test('mocks window.location', () => {
  // Save the original value of window.location
  const originalLocation = window.location;

  // Override window.location
  delete window.location;
  window.location = { href: 'http://example.com' };

  // Your test logic
  expect(window.location.href).toBe('http://example.com');

  // Restore the original window.location
  window.location = originalLocation;
});
```

#### 2. **Mocking Methods on `window`**

If you need to mock methods on `window`, you can use `jest.spyOn()`.

Example:
```javascript
test('mocks window.alert', () => {
  const alertSpy = jest.spyOn(window, 'alert').mockImplementation(() => {});

  window.alert('Hello');
  expect(alertSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello');

  alertSpy.mockRestore(); // Restore original method
});
```

### Mocking `document`

#### 1. **Mocking `document` Properties Directly**

You can similarly override properties on the `document` object.

Example:
```javascript
test('mocks document.title', () => {
  // Save the original value of document.title
  const originalTitle = document.title;

  // Override document.title
  document.title = 'Mocked Title';

  // Your test logic
  expect(document.title).toBe('Mocked Title');

  // Restore the original document.title
  document.title = originalTitle;
});
```

#### 2. **Mocking Methods on `document`**

For methods on `document`, you can use `jest.spyOn()`.

Example:
```javascript
test('mocks document.getElementById', () => {
  const getElementByIdSpy = jest.spyOn(document, 'getElementById').mockImplementation(() => ({
    innerHTML: 'Mocked Content'
  }));

  const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
  expect(element.innerHTML).toBe('Mocked Content');
  expect(getElementByIdSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('myElement');

  getElementByIdSpy.mockRestore(); // Restore original method
});
```

### General Tips

- **Restoring Original Values**: Always restore the original values or methods after your tests to avoid side effects on other tests. You can do this using `mockRestore()` for spies or by manually resetting the properties.
- **Setup and Teardown**: For complex cases, consider using `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to set up and clean up mocks.

These techniques allow you to control and test interactions with global objects in a predictable manner.
